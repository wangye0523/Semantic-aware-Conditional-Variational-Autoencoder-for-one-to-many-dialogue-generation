The kitchen stinks . __eou__  I'll throw out the garbage . __eou__
 Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . __eou__  Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . __eou__
 What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . __eou__  Not for me , Dick . __eou__
 Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . __eou__  Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__
 I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . __eou__  What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! __eou__
 Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . __eou__  Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . __eou__
 No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh . __eou__  Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day . __eou__
 Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day . __eou__  So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it . __eou__
 So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it . __eou__  I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . __eou__  No , thank you . __eou__
 I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story . __eou__  So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ? __eou__
 I'm really sorry . I'll face the music . __eou__  Where did you hit it ? __eou__
I'm sorry I'm late . __eou__  Better late than never . __eou__
 I'm sorry . I think we're out of this skirt in this color . Do you want me to call another one of our store to see if it's available there ? __eou__  No , that's all right . I'll just look for something else . __eou__
 Sorry . The road is too crowded . __eou__  But I have no time to lose . __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry . __eou__  That's all right . __eou__
 Not back home for dinner again ? That ’ s the third time this week ! __eou__  I ’ m sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that . __eou__  You don ’ t have to explain . Suit yourself . __eou__
I hate doing the damn laundry . __eou__  Watch your language . __eou__
 I ’ m afraid not . I apologize . __eou__  I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter . __eou__  I told you I ’ m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ? __eou__
 I told you I ’ m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ? __eou__  Well , you should be sorry ! Don ’ t ever use my computer again ! You can ’ t do anything now , it ’ s too late ! __eou__
 But mum , we're watching this movie . __eou__  I don't care , it's school in the morning . __eou__
You stink ! __eou__  I'll go take a shower . __eou__
Man ! That car almost hit me ! __eou__  Yeah , that was close . __eou__
The washing machine isn't working again . __eou__  It's not my fault . __eou__
What a mess ! __eou__  Sorry . I'll clean it up . __eou__
 Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more . __eou__  I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want . __eou__
 I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now . __eou__  Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon . __eou__
Sorry , I'm late . __eou__  It doesn't matter . __eou__
 Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . __eou__  Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? __eou__
 It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher . __eou__  More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry . __eou__
 But that still sounds expensive . __eou__  Sorry , we can ’ t come down any more . __eou__
 I'm so sorry . I have no idea of it . I washed silk dress the first time . I'll buy a new one for you or I'll give you money . __eou__  That's all right . Please ask me if you don't know how to do something next time . You can keep the silk dress if you don't mind . I think it fits you . __eou__
 I think it ’ s too expensive . I can just give you 4 yuan . Or I ’ ll go to another B . __eou__  All right . I ’ ll repair them for you . __eou__
Ouch ! I just bit my tongue . __eou__  Oh , that hurts . __eou__
 Oh , that hurts . __eou__  I think it's bleeding . __eou__
 Not from this brand , I'm afraid . __eou__  What about other brands ? __eou__
I'm so sorry about your brother , Mr . Wang . __eou__  Thanks , Jane . __eou__
 Uh ! Dad ! __eou__  Don't ' Uh , Dad ' me . Sit down and have some lovely breakfast . __eou__
 You don't know what you are asking ! __eou__  Please ! You can do it . Their clothes are all laid out on the bed . __eou__
 Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . __eou__  That's too bad . What problems are you having . __eou__
 That's too bad . What problems are you having . __eou__  Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . __eou__
 Oooo . This sounds serious . __eou__  Not too serious . But he gave me a strict diet to help bring it down . __eou__
 Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue ! __eou__  Oh , for Pete's sake . This is cosmetic . My brows are falling out . I did this for convenience . __eou__
 Come on mom . I'm your A ! Wait till the guys hear about this ! __eou__  Mike , don't even think about it ! __eou__
 It's too expensive . __eou__  If you think it's expensive . You can look at this one . __eou__
 Certainly not . __eou__  May I turn on the TV then ? __eou__
 So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__  Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? __eou__
 Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . __eou__  I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it . __eou__  Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ? __eou__
 I'm afraid it is . So you will have to pay two yuan extra . The total charge is four yuan . __eou__  All right . Here is the money . __eou__
 At least I enjoy my lunch ! What's in your bag ? __eou__  My wife sent me with rice , vegetables , and some curry chicken . __eou__
 No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire ! __eou__  I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated . __eou__
I'm going crazy . __eou__  What's the matter ? __eou__
Ann , it's terrible ! __eou__  What's up ? __eou__
 I think it's because of your bad habits ! __eou__  I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot . __eou__
 Sorry , but I'm not really that interested in those things . __eou__  Well , they are very nice you know . __eou__
 I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . __eou__  Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school . __eou__
 Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . __eou__  In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ? __eou__
 I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . __eou__  Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ? __eou__
 He is really outrageous . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . __eou__  What did you do ? __eou__
 I shouted it back of course . __eou__  Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? __eou__
 No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . __eou__  I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . __eou__
 It's none of your business . __eou__  Mom said you couldn't go out . __eou__
 I'm afraid that's the best we can do . __eou__  If so , I'd better try another store . __eou__
 Oh , I'm terribly sorry . but I couldn't find the yoghurt I saw here last time . __eou__  What's the brand ? __eou__
 I wish my parents were a little more lenient . __eou__  I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time . __eou__
 Well , I still hate having a curfew . __eou__  If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway . __eou__
 Why ? You can't be always so lazy . __eou__  Mom , I'm tired . I feel sleepy . I want to go to bed right now . __eou__
 Sorry , sir . That table has been reserved . This way , please . How about this one , sir ? __eou__  Fine . I'll sit here . __eou__
 Sorry . You can only pay in cash . __eou__  OK . Here you are . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number.There is no Stefan here . __eou__  Really ? Are you sure ? I called before and he was there . __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry I bothered you . I'm really sorry . __eou__  It doesn't matter . It happens to everyone . __eou__
 Sorry again for bothering you . __eou__  That's all right . __eou__
 I'm afraid he is not in at the moment . __eou__  May I ask what time he will come back ? __eou__
 But the lessons this semester are a little bit hard . __eou__  They aren't hard . I am sure you can do it . __eou__
 I am sorry , but you need a receipt for a refund . __eou__  But I purchased it yesterday . __eou__
 Oh , sorry to have bothered you . __eou__  It doesn't matter . Bye-bye ! __eou__
 My washing machine isn't working . __eou__  What's the problem ? __eou__
 That ’ s a little troublesome . __eou__  Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take No . 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate . __eou__
 I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here . __eou__  Oh , that's too bad . Where can you park around here ? __eou__
 Oh , that ’ s very sad . __eou__  Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . __eou__
 I'm sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that . __eou__  You don't have to explain . Suit yourself . __eou__
 Please forgive me . You have my word . I'll spend some time with you on the weekend . I promise . __eou__  We'll see . __eou__
 That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me . __eou__  I got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars . __eou__
 Oh my gosh . Damn ... screw the court , I would burn down their store . __eou__  We'll see what happens after court . __eou__
 I'm sorry . There are no sales today . __eou__  Are dresses going to be on sale ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , madam , there ’ s a limit to the speed . __eou__  Damn it ! I think I'm going to miss the plane . __eou__
 Damn it ! I think I'm going to miss the plane . __eou__  I'm sorry about that . What ’ s your flight time ? __eou__
 I'm sorry . I'll get you a new player . __eou__  At first , I thought it was me . __eou__
 I apologize for their tardiness . __eou__  I was late for work because of them . __eou__
 I was late for work because of them . __eou__  Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__
 Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__  I want my money back for the delivery . __eou__
 I want my money back for the delivery . __eou__  Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . __eou__
 No . I'm afraid the price is too low . __eou__  Then let's split the difference and I'll give you 60 yuan , OK ? __eou__
 I'm afraid you can't . __eou__  What is the material of this dress ? __eou__
 I'm afraid not . The price is very moderate . __eou__  It's rather more than I was thinking of paying . __eou__
 I'm afraid I'm going to the gym for a workout . __eou__  How long have you been there ? __eou__
 No so good . I broke traffic regulations yesterday and I got a ticket . __eou__  Could you tell me how you dealt with it this time ? __eou__
 Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried . __eou__  Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight . __eou__
 I feel so tired . __eou__  I really recommend you go for a run in the morning . __eou__
 I'm afraid he is not in at the moment . __eou__  Then what time do you think he will be in ? __eou__
 Sorry , but this is the best price . You can ’ t get it any cheaper than here . __eou__  I see . Can I pay by traveler ’ s checks ? __eou__
 Forget it ! It was a bitter pill for me to swallow . __eou__  It was the first time . You should not be so particular . __eou__
 I'm afraid not , sir . __eou__  What a pity ! __eou__
 Sorry , I forgot . I don ’ t like seafood , neither . __eou__  Let ’ s go over there and get some milk , a couple dozen eggs and some orange juice . __eou__
 I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale . __eou__  But that's what the ad said . __eou__
 I'm so sorry , but rules are rules . __eou__  OK , I'll just check out a few other stores . __eou__
 Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now . __eou__  I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ? __eou__
 I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you . __eou__  That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ? __eou__
Doctor , my child is nine years old , and I recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school . __eou__  Is he doing very well at school ? __eou__
 Promise that you won't get angry . __eou__  OK , I promise . What is it ? __eou__
 Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . __eou__  Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . __eou__
 No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . __eou__  Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . __eou__
 Just a moment , sir . Let me check the reservation list . Sorry , I'm afraid we're fully booked tonight . Would you like to make a reservation some other time ? __eou__  Do you have pot service at noon ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats . __eou__  Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one . __eou__
 We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . __eou__  I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . __eou__
 Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook . __eou__  No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . __eou__
 Hmm , I don't feel very comfortable . __eou__  Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ? __eou__
 I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? __eou__  Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . __eou__
 Okay , I'll be right back ... Congratulations ! The manager approved the final price $ 15,000 . __eou__  The price is fine if you give me free security system and free carpet mats . __eou__
 You are really tough . You got a deal . __eou__  Thanks ! __eou__
 I'm afraid this course is for four persons . __eou__  Well , can't you make it for two only ? __eou__
 I'm afraid not , sir . __eou__  I see . Well , what do you recommend then ? __eou__
How slowly you drive ! __eou__  I'm sorry . Something is wrong with my taxi . __eou__
 I'm sorry . Something is wrong with my taxi . __eou__  Where does it go wrong ? __eou__
 Oh , no ! What should I do now ? __eou__  Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and walk across the street and take the Bus 151 to the opposite direction . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but you got on the wrong bus . __eou__  Which bus should I take then ? __eou__
 No , cats are too dirty . They are lazy and cunning . I don ’ t like them at all . __eou__  I don ’ t think so . I think cats are sweet . __eou__
 I don't think so . You have to wait for about 10 minutes . __eou__  That's all right . __eou__
 Let me see ... I am sorry the tables you want are booked . __eou__  Well , since there are some small square tables , could we put two tables together ? __eou__
 Sorry , sir . That table has been booked . __eou__  Well , in that case , this table is the only choice . __eou__
 No , sir . I'm afraid not . __eou__  Oh , I see . How about the charges ? __eou__
 Sorry , sir . We have only double tables left . __eou__  What a pity . Can you recommend a nice restaurant near here ? __eou__
 I'm sorry to have bothered you . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but I don't know that name . You must have the wrong number . __eou__  Come on . I know Li Lin is there . Let me talk to her . __eou__
 I'm sorry to have bothered you . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 I am sorry , there are so many travelers that all our tables have been booked on that day . __eou__  In that case , please put my name in your waiting list . We know you are quite a good restaurant . __eou__
 I am sorry , madam . All the tables are booked now . __eou__  Well . In that case , we will have to go to another restaurant . Thank you all the same . __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number . __eou__  Are you sure this time ? __eou__
 Get out of it ! It wasn't as good as you think . __eou__  You'll get used to it , Mikel , trust me . __eou__
 I am sorry , sir . All the tables have been booked . __eou__  what a pity . __eou__
 what a pity . __eou__  Would you mind waiting in the lounge for 10 minutes ? I am sure I can arrange you a table then . __eou__
 I am sorry . That table has been booked . __eou__  It doesn't matter . This one is fine . __eou__
My parents are always saying I am not good enough . __eou__  Really . What do they mean ? __eou__
 No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash . __eou__  Well , I'd like to pay by cash . __eou__
 Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now . __eou__  I think you should be more careful next time . __eou__
 I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it . __eou__  That's all right . __eou__
 I am sorry , sir , it's for 4 persons to have . I think it's too large for you . __eou__  Would you please make it for a single person ? __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't see the stop sign at the corner . I didn't mean it . __eou__  That doesn't justify your violation . May I see your licence , please ? __eou__
 Oh , sorry , I don't have it on me . Honestly , I forgot it at the house . But I have the insurance policy with me . Here it is . __eou__  Well , sir , your insurance looks good , but I still have to write you a ticket . __eou__
 I want to have a car like that . But I am not rich . And I don ’ t have a rich daddy . __eou__  They are By new models now , they are not very expensive . Maybe you should look for one . __eou__
 I'm sorry , I must have been confused . I had thought it's C section , but actually it's D section . I'll move my car right away . __eou__  It's no big deal . Thank you . __eou__
 Let me see , I am sorry . It's for table 11 . __eou__  It doesn't matter . __eou__
 I am sorry , sir , the fish you ordered will take a longer time because we make it with fresh fish . __eou__  That's fine . Would you please bring me some wine ? __eou__
 It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves __eou__  Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb . __eou__
 Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track . __eou__  He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ’ t be off the beans . __eou__
 Sorry , sir . We receive credit card and cash only . __eou__  Here is my card . __eou__
 Let me see ... Sorry , sir . We are fully booked tonight . Would you mind making a reservation some other time ? __eou__  Do you offer mutton hot pot at noon ? __eou__
 I'm afraid you can ’ t . __eou__  Then can I exchange it for something else with the same price ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . __eou__  What ? Are you serious ? __eou__
 But nobody uses Macintosh ! __eou__  That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ? __eou__
 Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . __eou__  No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple . __eou__
 ... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs . __eou__  That's sulphur you can smell . The whole of Taiwan is a volcanic region . That's why Taiwan has so many hot springs . It's volcanic activity.The sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there . __eou__
 Oh , I'm very sorry about that . You can change it for another one if you prefer . __eou__  If you have exactly the same one-same color , same design , and same size , of course . __eou__
 What ? You're overcharging me ! __eou__  No way . Look . That's what the meter says . __eou__
 Oh dear ! What a pity ! Are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre ? __eou__  Yes , quite sure . __eou__
Ouch ! I'm hurt . __eou__  Are you all right ? __eou__
 Oh , that's too bad . Should I call a doctor ? __eou__  I'd appreciate it if you would . __eou__
 I'm afraid you'll have to find a parking meter . __eou__  Can I park here just for a second ? __eou__
It's your turn , sir . I'm sorry that you had to wait . Saturday is a busy day for us . __eou__  I suppose so . A haircut , please . __eou__
 This is not what I asked for . I'm afraid . __eou__  Oh , I'm so sorry . May I ask what you ordered again ? __eou__
 Oh , I'm so sorry . May I ask what you ordered again ? __eou__  Yes . What I ordered is roast beef , not roast beef sandwiches . __eou__
 I'm sorry . The restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you care to have a drink at the lounge until a table is available ? __eou__  No , thanks . We'll come back later . May I reserve a table for two ? __eou__
 That's sheer robbery ! __eou__  Believe me , it's worth the price . __eou__
 No . That price would hardly cover the cost . __eou__  What about 260 dollars ? __eou__
 I'm afraid you can't . You'll have to go out there and walk around . __eou__  I see.Thank you . __eou__
 I am sorry . Mr . Doff is out right now . __eou__  May I know when he will be back ? __eou__
 I am sorry , sir . We are booked until 9:10 . __eou__  In that case , please help us reserve a table for 4 at 9:00 . __eou__
 I am sorry , you have the wrong number . __eou__  Oh , I am really sorry . __eou__
 Sorry , things on sale are not allowed to be refunded or exchanged . __eou__  Oh , but this pair of shoes are a bit too tight . Could I change them for something bigger ? __eou__
 I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale . __eou__  Yes , they were thirty percent off . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items . __eou__  I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy . __eou__  I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here . Can you make an exception this time ? __eou__
 Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now . __eou__  That ’ s okay . I ’ ll call back later . __eou__
 Sorry , I don't have any sugar . __eou__  Why did you ask me if I wanted some ? __eou__
 Wow , your apartment is a mess . __eou__  I know , I didn't have time to put things away before you got here . __eou__
 Sorry , sir . It's the sale price . __eou__  Well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ? __eou__
 I'm afraid you've made a mistake . This isn't what I ordered . __eou__  So sorry , I must have confused the orders . I'll check it . __eou__
 So sorry , I must have confused the orders . I'll check it . __eou__  And also this soup is cold . __eou__
 You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else ! __eou__  Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out ! __eou__
 Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out ! __eou__  Just what gives you the right ... ? __eou__
 Just what gives you the right ... ? __eou__  Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady . __eou__
 Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady . __eou__  Well , you're no gentleman , either . __eou__
 Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day ! __eou__  What was that you just said ? Last one ... ? Hey , they've closed the ticket window ! __eou__
 Lady ! This is unfair ! I've been cheated ! I was in line before you.That should have been my ticket ! Come on , hand it over , lady ! __eou__  Gentleman ! Hah ! Fat chance ! Hah ! Eat your heart out , sucker ! Hah ! __eou__
 Sorry , sir , you have to pay in the check-out counter . It's there . __eou__  OK , please wrap it for me first . __eou__
 Sorry , you have the wrong number . There's no Brian here . __eou__  Is this 777-9345 ? __eou__
 Oh , I ’ m so sorry . __eou__  That's OK . __eou__
 Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle . __eou__  Wow ! All because of Super Bulk-Up . __eou__
 Oh , darn . Look what I've done . ( Spill the drink ) __eou__  Don't worry . I'll make you another on the house . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry . I think you are calling the wrong person . My name is not Mr . Bernie . __eou__  What ? That ’ s odd . I ’ m so sorry if I ’ Ve bothered you . __eou__
 What ? That ’ s odd . I ’ m so sorry if I ’ Ve bothered you . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 I am sorry . There is a speed limit . __eou__  Oh , my god . __eou__
 Which leg do you want to have , right leg or left one ? __eou__  Thanks , thanks a lot and thanks a million . __eou__
 I'm absolutely useless at cooking ! __eou__  I could teach you how to cook something healthy . Frozen pizza are so bad for you ! __eou__
I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . __eou__  May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ? __eou__
 I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off . __eou__  What happened ? Did you have a fight ? __eou__
 I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . __eou__  It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . __eou__
 It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . __eou__  We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . __eou__
 Sorry . It is the smallest size we have . __eou__  Too bad . But , is there any other leather store nearby ? __eou__
 Too bad . But , is there any other leather store nearby ? __eou__  Oh , yes . There is a big one at the right corner of the street . Perhaps you will get one there . __eou__
Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this . __eou__  Tell me what seems to be the problem . __eou__
 My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep . __eou__  Did you ever talk to him about it ? __eou__
My stomach's growling again ! __eou__  You'll never lose weight if you listen to your stomach . __eou__
 Sorry , I made a mistake . They're on the right side of the TV . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! __eou__  I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . __eou__
Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic ! __eou__  If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy ! __eou__
 If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy ! __eou__  He sounds like a sick cow ! __eou__
 He sounds like a sick cow ! __eou__  Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key . __eou__
 That's true . You can hear my tummy grumbling . I am really hungry ! __eou__  Be patient . Good food never comes fast . __eou__
 Shut up ! Now you are in my car , you should listen to me . Or you can get off . I've told you I'm in a hurry . I don't want to waste time on the road . __eou__  No . You shouldn't drive like that . __eou__
 Oh , no . That's bad news . __eou__  It sure is , but I'm going to call HP first , just to make sure . __eou__
I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . __eou__  cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? __eou__
 yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . __eou__  is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey . __eou__
 but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? __eou__  of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal . __eou__
 Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying . __eou__  But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started.Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! __eou__
 It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . __eou__  What ’ s the time ? __eou__
 It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . __eou__  Are you sure half past seven ? __eou__
 I'm sorry . __eou__  Do you know this is a Onaway street ? __eou__
Shit , so crowded ! __eou__  The radio said it's OK on this road . __eou__
What a terrible house ! __eou__  I'm sick of it , too . __eou__
 The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking __eou__  There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! __eou__
 There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! __eou__  It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! __eou__
I'll be late because I have waited so long ! __eou__  Don't worry.The bus will arrive soon . __eou__
 I'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus . __eou__  We have to wait six more minutes ! __eou__
I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door . __eou__  You're so careless , Billy . __eou__
 Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . __eou__  I've done it for you . __eou__
 Sorry , darling , I forgot . __eou__  When will you buy it then ? __eou__
 Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . __eou__  Yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . If we had gone early we would miss the traffic . __eou__
 You said you were only going to window shop ! __eou__  I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! __eou__
 I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! __eou__  I should have known ... __eou__
 I am worrying about it too . I want to install a security door . __eou__  Is the security door useful ? __eou__
 I am afraid not , darling . Our expenses are mounting . __eou__  We have to cut back on our shopping from now on . __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry . __eou__  Don ’ t worry . Just check in your bag before entering . __eou__
 I'm sorry , this is our rock bottom price . __eou__  Alright , I ’ ll buy this one . __eou__
 Sorry , you can only pay cash . __eou__  OK . Here is the money . __eou__
 Sorry . I didn't know . __eou__  The total comes to US $ 65.81 . How will you pay today ? __eou__
Oh dear , I ’ m late . I have to be in the office by 8am . __eou__  Oh really what ’ s happening ? __eou__
 Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . __eou__  What ' the matter ? __eou__
 The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . __eou__  I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . __eou__
 Oh no . I broke your vase accidentally . __eou__  How did it happen ? __eou__
 Well , there's nothing I can do about my height ! __eou__  There's a petite section that you an check out . __eou__
 Too bad . I really like it . __eou__  Why don't you try this other T-shirt ? I think it would look nice on you . __eou__
Look at the traffic . It ’ s terrible ! __eou__  I know . There are too many cars on the roads these days . __eou__
Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . __eou__  That's true . During rush hours , taxis are just as quick as buses . __eou__
 Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . __eou__  Way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__
 No , Madam . I don't think I do . __eou__  It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street . __eou__
Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . __eou__  I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . __eou__
 Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that ! __eou__  Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry . You can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase . __eou__  But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty . __eou__
I'm very annoyed at your disobedience . __eou__  But mum , I didn't mess it up . __eou__
 Sorry , mum . I won't do it again . __eou__  You'd better remember your promise . __eou__
I'm worrying that she may be lost . __eou__  Be relaxed . She is familiar with the area . __eou__
Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather . __eou__  Yes . And they don ’ t give you very much either . I ’ m still hungry . __eou__
 Yes . And they don ’ t give you very much either . I ’ m still hungry . __eou__  I ’ m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant . __eou__
 I ’ m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant . __eou__  Don ’ t do this ! Don ’ t do that ! You mustn ’ t do this ! You can ’ t do that ! __eou__
 Don ’ t do this ! Don ’ t do that ! You mustn ’ t do this ! You can ’ t do that ! __eou__  Well , I ’ m going to write a letter of complaint . __eou__
 Well , I ’ m going to write a letter of complaint . __eou__  And we ’ ll all help you . __eou__
 Really , it's so beautiful . __eou__  You like it . Well , I'll gather it for you . __eou__
 Try to be more careful in future . Look ! You ’ Ve damaged the sign . __eou__  Is this the sign ? What does it say ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet.Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ? __eou__  All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . __eou__
 I'm afraid I can't . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
Oh , no . It seems that I've lost my train ticket . __eou__  Are you kidding ? The train leaves in an hour . Where did you put it ? __eou__
 I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! __eou__  You wouldn't do a thing like that ! __eou__
I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? __eou__  You look a bit pale , don't you ? __eou__
 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . __eou__  You should get plenty of sleep . __eou__
 I drink a lot of wine . __eou__  If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . __eou__
 I often feel so tired . __eou__  You better do some exercise every morning . __eou__
 I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . __eou__  Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . __eou__
 It ’ s unfair . __eou__  Well , we can do nothing about it . __eou__
 Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . __eou__  Will you have it later ? __eou__
 I'm not sure if we've got any now . Books of that kind are on this shelf . Well , I'm afraid we've sold out . __eou__  What a pity ! I should have come earlier . __eou__
 What a pity ! I should have come earlier . __eou__  Come some time next week if you like . I think we'll have got some by then . __eou__
 I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months . __eou__  My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks.Is the house in good condition ? __eou__
 Sorry . You have to buy your ticket at the next counter . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday . __eou__  Oh dad . You don't understand at all . __eou__
 Oh , don't you ? God save me ! __eou__  I'm sorry . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , Jim . __eou__  Never mind , dear . __eou__
 Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag . __eou__  Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ? __eou__
 No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about . __eou__  You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . __eou__
 You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . __eou__  What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ? __eou__
 I'm afraid I can't . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling ! __eou__  I wish I'd put it in the bank . __eou__
 Good heavens , am I really ? I'm so sorry , I didn't notice . __eou__  I'm sorry , sir , but I'll have to give you a ticket . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir , but I'll have to give you a ticket . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? __eou__  Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more . __eou__
 But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? __eou__  Oh , I don't know.Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days . __eou__
 But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? __eou__  A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . __eou__
 Sorry , we ' re sold out right now.Please come back next week . __eou__  Ok , Thanks . __eou__
 What a pity ! I should have come earlier . __eou__  Come some time next week if you like . I think we'll have got some by them . __eou__
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . __eou__  That ’ s all right . __eou__
 It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . __eou__  What ’ s the time ? __eou__
 It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . __eou__  Are you sure half past seven ? __eou__
 My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? __eou__
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? __eou__  Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . __eou__
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! __eou__  I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__
 I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__  I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? __eou__
 What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! __eou__  Don't panic ! We'll help you get out of the building safely . __eou__
 I can smell smoke ! __eou__  Please follow my instructions . Use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose . Walk quietly to th nearest emergency exit . Now go get the wet towel . __eou__
 Gosh ! I can see the flames ! __eou__  Crouch down and try not to breathe in the smoke . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__  What ? What did you buy ? __eou__
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__  What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__
What a mess , Jack ! __eou__  I ’ m playing with my toys , Dad . __eou__
Jack , let ’ s go ! __eou__  Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ? __eou__
 Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible ! __eou__  Take it easy . They will get caught . __eou__
What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . __eou__  Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ? __eou__
 It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . __eou__  C'mon . Just don't move . __eou__
 I'm bleeding too much . __eou__  We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? __eou__
 Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! __eou__  There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . __eou__
 No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . __eou__  Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? __eou__
 Let me see ... I'm sorry , but we don't have any more non-smoking rooms.We won't charge you for your room tonight . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 I'm very sorry about this . __eou__  That's OK . Thanks for your help . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but I really need it this afternoon . __eou__  Well , could you drive me home ? I have spare keys there . __eou__
 A really dreadful accident and many people were killed . __eou__  Is that true ? __eou__
 It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . __eou__  What ’ s the time ? __eou__
 It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . __eou__  Are you sure half past seven ? __eou__
 Sorry . You have to buy your ticket at the next counter . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 i think i'll be a little afraid . __eou__  of what ? __eou__
 afraid of making a mistake . __eou__  no mistakes in a tango Donar.not like life , simple , that will make the tango so great . if you make a mistake , you'll get all tango done . just tango along . why don't you try ? will you try it . __eou__
 Look for it yourself , please ! Kinda busy here , Daniel ! __eou__  Dad ? __eou__
Oh , come on , Ultraman ! __eou__  What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ? __eou__
 Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either ! __eou__  That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ? __eou__
 Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner ! __eou__  OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here . __eou__
 Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . __eou__  But it's the same hairstyle . __eou__
 Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham . __eou__  He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right . __eou__
 Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . __eou__  Do it , please . __eou__
What a terrible house ! __eou__  I'm sick of it , too . __eou__
 The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . __eou__  It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . __eou__
 Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now . __eou__  Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come . __eou__
 Let me see ... Oh , I am awfully sorry sir . __eou__  That's all right . __eou__
 I told you to hurry up a thousand times . You just put a deaf ear to it . __eou__  Did you ? I didn't hear you . It was too noisy . __eou__
 It's all your fault ! Now we can't get in shopping . __eou__  OK , it's my fault . I'll stay here and look after our stuff . You can get in , shopping with Daniel and May . __eou__
 I'm sorry , I didn't know that . But I wanna help . __eou__  Umm , let me think for a moment . We can meet her together after I finish cooking . __eou__
That's unfair , Mom . __eou__  What's up ? Honey ! __eou__
 Gross ! __eou__  Hurry up ! The smile is frozen on my face . __eou__
Excuse me , sir , I'm afraid you can't park your car here . __eou__  Why not ? It's my parking space . __eou__
 Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space . __eou__  That's all right . It's not your fault . __eou__
 You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off . __eou__  Where ? my car ? __eou__
 No , mine ! __eou__  Thank goodness ! __eou__
 That's terrible . __eou__  I am sorry to say this , sir , but you should've been more careful . __eou__
 I apologize for that . But the space is too small . __eou__  What about the damage to my car ? What are you gonna do about that ? __eou__
I am sorry for damaging your car , sir . __eou__  Don't worry about it . Just leave it to the insurance companies . __eou__
 What a shame ! I didn't see them . __eou__  Well , can you help me look for it ? That's my first time here . __eou__
 I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals . __eou__  Oh , come on , they give them treat too.Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute . __eou__
 Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please . __eou__  Why are you acting so strange today ? __eou__
 I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding . __eou__  That's weird ! __eou__
 I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon . __eou__  OK , please . __eou__
 It doesn't seem like that . Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think . __eou__  It's been several days now , I am not sure . __eou__
 I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time . __eou__  OK , I will . __eou__
 I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . __eou__  Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? __eou__
 Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money . __eou__  I know that I should learn how to save more , but I hope that we can spend a little on ourselves sometimes . __eou__
Sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . I have to deal with it . Perhaps I will go to back home till very late . __eou__  It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway . __eou__
 Can you take he away from me ? __eou__  I ’ m just coming for that . __eou__
That was really a nightmare ! __eou__  Honey , what's up ? __eou__
 I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator . __eou__  Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ? __eou__
 I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . __eou__  Did you panic at the time ? __eou__
This house is very nice for me , but I can ’ t afford it in a lump sum . __eou__  Don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once . __eou__
I'm sorry I'm so late . I had a really bad day . __eou__  It's ten after six.We ' re late.But dinner is at six thirty . __eou__
 I know . I know . I'm really sorry . I lost my bag . __eou__  I'll call the lost and found office . __eou__
 Terrible . __eou__  What's wrong ? __eou__
 I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it . __eou__  Well , I certainly did . __eou__
Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! __eou__  I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . __eou__  What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! __eou__
 I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! __eou__  This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! __eou__
 Whatever . Just turn right here . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . let ’ s take a side street . Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! __eou__  What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! __eou__
 What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! __eou__  Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady ! __eou__
Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head ! __eou__  What did I do ? I haven't done anything . __eou__
 That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . __eou__  I don't need your help , jerk . __eou__
 I don't need your help , jerk . __eou__  Whatever you say . __eou__
 Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway . __eou__  Do you have a club card or will it be cash ? __eou__
This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . __eou__  You look a little lost , can I help you ? __eou__
Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... __eou__  Hello , welcome to Universal Bank . Please insert your card into the slot . __eou__
 I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... __eou__  Please input your 6 digit PIN code followed by the pound key . Thank you . Please select an option.Thank you . You have selected withdrawal . __eou__
 Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just gimme my money ! __eou__  Please type the amount you would like to withdraw . Thank you , you want to transfer 10000 USD to the World Wildlife Foundation . If this is correct please press 1 . __eou__
 No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! __eou__  Confirmed . Thank you for using our bank ! Please remove your card from the slot . Goodbye ! __eou__
 No , no way ! What happened ? Give me my money ! __eou__  Danger , danger ! The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked in until the local authorities arrive . Thank you for using our bank . Have a nice day . __eou__
 I haven't even told you what it is yet ! __eou__  Okay , okay , what do you want ? __eou__
 Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! __eou__  Who's this Eric guy ? __eou__
 No can do ... sorry . __eou__  Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ? __eou__
 I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy . __eou__  I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit . __eou__
 Good idea . I'd suggest you do some crunches too . Thery're great for getting in shape . Make sure you do them correctly . __eou__  Ok . I will . Could you help me with the treadmill ? I found it difficult to get the setting right last time . __eou__
Mom ! I hate eating vegetables ! __eou__  You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind . __eou__
 But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair ! __eou__  You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . __eou__
 I can ’ t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours ! __eou__  looks like you might like the soft sleeper then . __eou__
 Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway . __eou__  How far is that ? __eou__
 I'm afraid I can't . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault . If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . __eou__  Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . __eou__
 I know , I am sorry I ever bought it . __eou__  I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television . __eou__
 I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! __eou__  You wouldn't do a thing like that ! __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , Jim . __eou__  Never mind , dear . __eou__
 Oh , breaktime flies . __eou__  come on , baby . It ’ s time now . __eou__
 I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet . Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ? __eou__  All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . __eou__
 It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . __eou__  Sorry , love . __eou__
 Sorry , love . __eou__  What are you looking for now ? __eou__
 It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice . __eou__  Yes , it would . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine . __eou__
I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? __eou__  You look a bit pale , don't you ? __eou__
 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . __eou__  You should get plenty of sleep . __eou__
 I drink a lot of wine . __eou__  If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . __eou__
 I often feel so tired . __eou__  You better do some exercise every morning . __eou__
 I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . __eou__  Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . __eou__
 I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight . __eou__  No , exactly not . __eou__
 I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say . __eou__  It says ' No smoking ' . __eou__
 Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . __eou__  OK . Here's the key . Take care . __eou__
 I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months . __eou__  My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ? __eou__
 No , Madam . I don't think I do . __eou__  It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street . __eou__
Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! __eou__  I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! __eou__
 I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! __eou__  Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . __eou__
 Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . __eou__  Banker ? __eou__
 Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday . __eou__  Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back . __eou__
 Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me . __eou__  It's nothing personal , just business . __eou__
I know why Mr . Fro didn't like our ad idea ! He doesn't know the first thing about coffee . __eou__  True . I always see him drinking instant . __eou__
 Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom ! __eou__  Your throat must be swollen . __eou__
 Yuck ! __eou__  I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad . __eou__
Ouch ! The water's too hot ! __eou__  Get in slowly , sweetie . You'll get used to it . I'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup . __eou__
 Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ? __eou__  That's a good sign . But just soak a little longer , OK ? __eou__
 Why ? It's in mint condition ! __eou__  That's why I can profit from it ! __eou__
 Aw , Mom-you're such a drag . __eou__  You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best . __eou__
This is awful ! It's like drinking saltwater ! It's like drowning in the ocean ! __eou__  Don't be so dramatic . You're such a baby . Now sit down and finish your soup . __eou__
 I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! __eou__  I'm doing my best , Grandma ... __eou__
 Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! __eou__  Uh-oh , here we go ... __eou__
 You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here ! __eou__  Yes'm . __eou__
 You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it ! __eou__  Yes'm . __eou__
 And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house ! __eou__  Yes'm . __eou__
 I knew there would be a catch ! __eou__  Nothing in life is free , Son . __eou__
Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty ! __eou__  Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ? __eou__
 I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it ! __eou__  You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ? __eou__
 I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! __eou__  Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ? __eou__
 I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos . __eou__  Sure I ' ll have the burrito . Do you have nachos ? __eou__
 I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages . __eou__  Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways . __eou__
 Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages . __eou__  Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month . __eou__
 I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight . __eou__  In that case , eight o'clock is fine . __eou__
 Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning . __eou__  Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat ! __eou__
 I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems . __eou__  Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ? __eou__
 I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . __eou__  You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . __eou__
 But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? __eou__  The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . __eou__
 Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . __eou__  This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . __eou__
 Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish ! __eou__  Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liquid foundation . __eou__
 Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon ! __eou__  What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... __eou__
 What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... __eou__  Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon ! __eou__
 It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! __eou__  It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but now it ’ s a G-natural . Now add the bass clef . You ’ re going too fast . Remember the tempo for this piece is andante . __eou__
 Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . __eou__  That ’ s ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any other musician , your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship . __eou__
We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! __eou__  Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! __eou__
 Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! __eou__  Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? __eou__
 I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! __eou__  What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . __eou__
Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? __eou__  It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . __eou__
 Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . __eou__  Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__

Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? __eou__
I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need ! __eou__  What are you getting ? __eou__
 That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . __eou__  It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather , but at least the sun will come out . I advise weekend travelers to be careful , especially while driving . Back to you , Mark . __eou__
 Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? __eou__  I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . __eou__
 Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! __eou__  Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! __eou__
 Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . __eou__  Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! __eou__
 Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! __eou__  When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! __eou__
 I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . __eou__  Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! __eou__
 Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! __eou__  What ’ s wrong ? __eou__
 I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me ! __eou__  Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . __eou__
 Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! __eou__  Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . __eou__
 It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry . __eou__  Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . __eou__
 Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ... __eou__  It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ? __eou__
 I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black ! __eou__  Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus . __eou__
 I don ’ t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ’ m fine . __eou__  No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans . __eou__
 All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! __eou__  What are you talking about ? I have salads some times . __eou__
 Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! __eou__  Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? __eou__
 My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! __eou__  Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems . __eou__
 Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . __eou__  Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ? __eou__
 Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food ! __eou__  Humph ! Right , so what did you get ? __eou__
 Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! __eou__  We still need to find an armoire and a dresser . __eou__
 Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . __eou__  Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . __eou__
 Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! __eou__  Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but this was on sale , so I can only give you store credit . __eou__  Fine . Here's my receipt . I'd better be able to use this anywhere in the store . __eou__
I'm sorry , sir . I'm going to have to ask you to leave . __eou__  What ? I was just having a friendly conversation with the lady here ... __eou__
 Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache . __eou__  Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine ! __eou__
 I'm worried that everything will be chaotic ! __eou__  Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests . __eou__
 Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song ! __eou__  I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . __eou__
 I'm sorry.My car's taken . __eou__  Where is the next taxi stand ? __eou__
It's your turn , sir.Sorry to keep you waiting . __eou__  That's all right . __eou__
 It's a pity . I'm afraid that's too loud for me.Thank you . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 I'm afraid I don't quite understand . __eou__  I see.You ' re a stranger here.Walk two blocks ahead , then turn left . You can't miss it . __eou__
 I'm sorry I've already gone through my paycheck for the week . __eou__  Thank you just the same . __eou__
 I'm afraid that's a bit beyond my means . __eou__  Then you can try some local products.They ' re also of good quality . __eou__
 No , I'm afraid we'll have to cancel the order . I'm not sure whether it agrees with me . __eou__  Would you like anything else ? __eou__
It's your turn , sir . I'm sorry that you've had to wait . __eou__  That's all right.Show me the blue pen , please . __eou__
Staying out all night , you frightened me to death . __eou__  I stayed with my friends . __eou__
 You should at least give me a call . __eou__  I'm sorry , Mum . __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir . What exactly is problem ? __eou__  Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably . __eou__
 Oh , I'm afraid we've sold out of those . They were really popular . __eou__  Will you be getting more in . __eou__
 It's me , Ali . There's this strange guy who keeps coming around . He's been here three times this week . __eou__  He's probably a pervert . Just ignore him . __eou__
 He makes me nervous . He looks at me funny . And he never buys anything ! __eou__  Maybe he wants to get something for his girlfriend , but he's embarrassed . __eou__
 Now he's looking over here ! He's coming ! __eou__  OK ! I'll call security . __eou__
Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mike ! __eou__  If I hear " Love Me Tender " one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy ! __eou__
 If I hear " Love Me Tender " one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy ! __eou__  He sounds like a sick cow ! __eou__
 He sounds like a sick cow ! __eou__  Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key . __eou__
Shut up ... Billy ... BILLY ! __eou__  What ! __eou__
Oh . I just wanted you to shut up . You were off-key anyway . Let me see that ! __eou__  OK ... just grab it right out of my hands ... __eou__
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? __eou__  Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . __eou__
 It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . __eou__  You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . __eou__
 You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . __eou__  Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! __eou__
 Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! __eou__  It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . __eou__
 Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . __eou__  I won't . __eou__
 But there are only two more days until the bidding closes ! __eou__  I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off ! __eou__
 I'm sorry we don't ship overseas . It's too much trouble . __eou__  I understand you don't have a history of shipping overseas , but I am willing to pay extra for shipping . __eou__
 Don't you dare tell me that ... __eou__  I'm sorry . I didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats . __eou__
 I'm sorry . I didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats . __eou__  Well , they should have called you ! __eou__
 Well , they should have called you ! __eou__  They said that they did . I've been so busy ... __eou__
 They said that they did . I've been so busy ... __eou__  And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? __eou__
 And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? __eou__  I didn't think there would be a problem . __eou__
 It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets ! __eou__  I'm sorry . We're still going . I got reservations for all of us on the 31st . It will be OK . Trust me . __eou__
 I'm sorry . We're still going . I got reservations for all of us on the 31st . It will be OK . Trust me . __eou__  Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations ! __eou__
 Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations ! __eou__  Brooke ! __eou__
 No ! Christmas without him is bad enough . So , honey , do you have cold feet yet ? __eou__  Yeah , especially since Jack didn't take care of the plane reservations . __eou__
 I'm afraid not . The church is booked until the year 2001 . __eou__  Then where will we have the ceremony ? At home ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , Mom . __eou__  Don't worry , dear . I'm a great host . Now get some rest . Merry Christmas . __eou__
 I am sorry . I am very tired . I'm going to bed early . __eou__  What about tomorrow evening ? __eou__
 No , I ’ m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I'm in a hurry now . __eou__  But Ann .. __eou__
 I'm afraid she's out . __eou__  Can you give her a message , please ? __eou__
Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting my main dish for quite a time . __eou__  Yes sir , just a minute , please . I ’ ll check with the kitchen . Thank you for waiting . It takes another 10 to 15 minutes , I ’ m afraid . __eou__
Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way . __eou__  Did you have hotel card or something ? __eou__
 Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment . __eou__  What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss . __eou__
I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . __eou__  May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ? __eou__
I'm a little nervous . __eou__  Don't worry . You'll be fine . First of all , put on your seat belt . Adjust the mirrors . __eou__
 I ’ m terribly sorry . May I have your order again ? I'll get it right away . __eou__  I've ordered savory pork and coleslaw . __eou__
 I'm sorry . I must have made a mistake . I'll bring them for you at once . __eou__  Hey ! What is this ? __eou__
 Sorry . I'm afraid we can't . But you may order something else instead . __eou__  Oh , really ? Give me a clam soup . __eou__
 I am awfully sorry but there are no vacancies left now . Would you like to wait for a moment ? __eou__  How long a wait do you think there ’ ll be ? __eou__
 I am sorry for making you wait so long . Now there is a table available in non-smoking section . Please follow me . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Oooo ... gross ... you're sweating all over the place . __eou__  It's your fault for mixing the two broths ! __eou__
 It's your fault for mixing the two broths ! __eou__  You're going to have a little Montezuma's revenge tomorrow morning . __eou__
 No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash . __eou__  Well , I don't have any cash with me , so I ’ ll have to put it on credit . __eou__
 Sorry , madam . We have stopped selling those kinds of eggs for a week . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 Oh , My God ! That's terrible . __eou__  Yes , so they are no longer being sold . __eou__
 We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ? __eou__  Well , you know , those styles or colors don ’ t suit me . __eou__
 Sorry , it had been sold out . __eou__  What a pity ! __eou__
 That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! __eou__  Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . __eou__
 Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . __eou__  I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . __eou__
 But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it . __eou__  I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry.She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nine.Can I take a message for her ? __eou__  Thank you.But I will call her later . __eou__

 I'm sorry , sir , but may I see your driver's licence and insurance policy , please ? I have to give you a ticket . __eou__  Here they are . __eou__
 Sorry , darling , I forgot . __eou__  When will you buy it then ? __eou__
I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door . __eou__  You're so careless , Billy . __eou__
 Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . __eou__  I've done it for you . __eou__
 I am sorry , sir . But may I see your driver's license and insurance policy , PLS ? I have to give you a ticket . __eou__  Here they are . __eou__

 I ’ m sorry to hear that.You ’ d better stay at home.After all , we can visit Mrs.Brown later __eou__  OK.Bye - bye . __eou__
 Toilets are in the rear . I'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment . __eou__  What ? __eou__
Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway . __eou__  How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ? __eou__
 Yeah . It ’ s pretty bad , that car looks like a coke can . __eou__  These accidents always cause traffic jams on rainy days . __eou__
 The post office.Sorry . I ’ m not sure . __eou__  Well . Thanks any way __eou__
Sorry to bother you . But I ’ m having a small problem I thought you might be able to help me with . __eou__  Sure Paula , shoot ! __eou__
 Sorry , but she ’ s out . __eou__  Could you tell her Tom Green called ? __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Baker ’ s not in . May I take your message ? __eou__  Yes , tell him Mr . Cook called and ask him to return my called as soon as he back . __eou__
 I ’ m afraid you ’ re going in the opposite direction . __eou__  Should I take a bus ? __eou__
 Is that right ? We're very sorry . __eou__  I thought it was " the same day " service.Anyway , please do hurry . __eou__
 I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock . __eou__  Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ? __eou__
You shouldn't let the dirty dishes accumulate in the sink ! __eou__  I know , I should wash them right away . __eou__
 I ... I failed to pass the examination . How I wish I had studied hard . __eou__  Oh . Take it easy . You can set your aim from today . __eou__
 Curse this oven ! Curse it ! __eou__  But I prefer burnt bread . __eou__
 Curse the worst oven in the world . __eou__  Wonderful ! A perfect piece of bread ! __eou__
 Sorry , I didn ’ t prepare this . __eou__  Then , I ’ d like some eggs and bread for breakfast instead . __eou__
 Sorry , I ’ m looking for my wallet . __eou__  You lost your wallet ? Anything important in it ? __eou__
 Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I think you ’ d better talk to the police officer walking there . __eou__  It seems that is a better way . Thank you . __eou__
 I'm sorry to say " No . " __eou__  Here , I'll take a taxi instead.How do you refund us ? __eou__
 I don't get it . I'll go and have that doorman talk to you then . __eou__  OK , ma'am . Calm down , 15 dollars will do . __eou__
Is your turn , Sir . I ‘ m sorry that you have to wait . Saturday is busy day for us . __eou__  I suppose so . Hair cut , please . __eou__
 Thank you for waiting.It takes another ten to fifteen minutes , I'm afraid . __eou__  We have an appointment in half an hour . __eou__
 That's too bad.What kind of accident is it ? Are you all right ? __eou__  I'm all right , but my friend is seriously injured.Will you call an ambulance and the police ? __eou__
 Sorry , no . We only take MasterCard or Visa . __eou__  I ’ ll put it on my Visa card , then . __eou__
 Sorry , madam . I afraid you have a wrong number.we don't have Mr Over here . __eou__  I want 6420422 3 , is that right ? __eou__

 I ’ m sorry She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ? __eou__  Thank you.But I will call her later __eou__
 I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now . __eou__  I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time . __eou__
 Sorry , he's out . __eou__  What time you suspect back them ? __eou__
 Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ? __eou__  No , thanks . I'll call back later . __eou__
 I am afraid not . Have you lost your passport ? __eou__  I think so . I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place I used it yesterday was in this department store . __eou__
 Well , let me call the shoe department to see if they ’ Ve found a passport . Sorry , your passport hasn't turned up there either . __eou__  Then what shall I do ? __eou__
Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here . __eou__  Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ? __eou__
 Cash , credit card , cheque anything . I just have to see a doctor . I am in pain . __eou__  All right , all right , relax . I am only trying to do my job . __eou__
 He is not answering . You'd better check his pulse and breathing . __eou__  Oh , no . He is not breathing and there ’ s no pulse . Call 911 . __eou__
 Ur , it stinks ! __eou__  Now you know you have to clean your bathtub every time when you use it . __eou__
Oh , my goodness . The traffic is crawling . __eou__  I think there is an accident ahead . __eou__
 Sorry , all the tables for three are reserved . __eou__  Do you have a table for four , please ? __eou__
 Oh , lilies of the valley . No , I am sorry . We are all out of them right now . __eou__  Oh , that's too bad . __eou__
 I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans . __eou__  I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday . __eou__
 No , I'm afraid not . We only accept our own store credit card . __eou__  Oh . In that case , I'll pay cash . __eou__
 But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! __eou__  I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me . __eou__
 I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me . __eou__  I didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference . __eou__
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? __eou__  Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . __eou__
This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . __eou__  You look a little lost , can I help you ? __eou__
 Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! __eou__  Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things . __eou__
 Fine ! What do you need ? __eou__  OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get s __eou__
 I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet . __eou__  Any idea when he might be back ? __eou__
I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . __eou__  cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? __eou__
No , it hasn't . It's very dirty . __eou__  Someone ought to clean it today . __eou__
 I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment . __eou__  When do you expect him back ? __eou__
 I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black ! __eou__  Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus . __eou__
 I don ’ t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ’ m fine . __eou__  No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans . __eou__
 Oh . I enjoy watching boxing on television , too.What a pity I missed it last night ! __eou__  What did you do last night ? __eou__
 Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon ! __eou__  What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... __eou__
 What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... __eou__  Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon ! __eou__
Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! __eou__  Are you trying to lose weight ? __eou__
 Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . __eou__  Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! __eou__
 Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! __eou__  When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! __eou__
 No , you don ’ t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ’ s gonna kill me ! __eou__  OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . __eou__  What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! __eou__
Ah ! No ! Damn it ! __eou__  It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . __eou__
 Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . __eou__  I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . __eou__
 Mom ! That is so unfair ! __eou__  You know the rules and you broke them . No allowance and no TV for a week . I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down ! __eou__
 Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! __eou__  What sort of pest are we dealing with ? __eou__
 We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! __eou__  Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fu __eou__
We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! __eou__  Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty ! __eou__
 Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class . __eou__  You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so __eou__
Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . __eou__  I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! __eou__
 Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . __eou__  I think my arm is broken . __eou__
 Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . __eou__  Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . __eou__
 To hell with you . The accident was your fault . __eou__  I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? __eou__
Honey , the house is such a mess ! I need you to help me tidy up a bit . My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless ! __eou__  I ’ m in the middle of something right now . I ’ ll be there in a second . __eou__
 This can ’ t wait ! I need your help now ! __eou__  Alright , alright . I ’ m coming . __eou__
 It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . __eou__  C'mon . Just don't move . __eou__
 Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! __eou__  There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . __eou__
 No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . __eou__  Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? __eou__
 I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! __eou__  We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . __eou__
 Sorry , it ’ s all sold out . __eou__  Well , do you have any for tomorrow ? __eou__
 Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! __eou__  Who's this Eric guy ? __eou__
 That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! __eou__  Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . __eou__
 Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . __eou__  I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . __eou__
 But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive . __eou__  Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars . __eou__
 It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . __eou__  Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . __eou__
 Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . __eou__  Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . __eou__
 To hell with you . The accident was your fault . __eou__  I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? __eou__
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! __eou__  I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__
 I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__  I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? __eou__
Ah ! No ! Damn it ! __eou__  It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . __eou__
 No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . __eou__  I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . __eou__
 Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . __eou__  I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . __eou__
Mom , Dad ! Can you come to my room ? I think there is something under my bed ! __eou__  Son , you just go back to bed , and stop crying wolf . __eou__
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know . __eou__  What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ? __eou__
 No , I ’ m afraid not . __eou__  Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first . __eou__
 I'm afraid not . __eou__  Then I have to call another taxi , or I'll be late . __eou__
 Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . __eou__  Get new friends . __eou__
 Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! __eou__  But you bought it only last month . __eou__
 I am really sorry . __eou__  It's ok . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , but you won ’ t be able to view it today . __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 Unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today . __eou__  Why can ’ t I view it today ? __eou__
Mom , I hate eating vegetables ! __eou__  You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind . __eou__
 But I don ’ t like them.It ’ s not fair . __eou__  You can have some fruits for dessert.If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . __eou__
 I'm sorry , it was too cold , and my car couldn't start . I had one to the garage with the heater . I tried to call you , but you couldn't get connection . __eou__  Couldn't get connection ? __eou__
Hello ! We ’ Ve been waiting for our lunch order for over an hour . Did you forget our order ? __eou__  I ’ m sorry , sir . Could you tell me your name and order again , please ? I ’ ll check on the delay . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , sir . Could you tell me your name and order again , please ? I ’ ll check on the delay . __eou__  The name ’ s Stanley Morris and the order was for two chef ’ s salads . __eou__
 I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . __eou__  taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . __eou__
this bloody computer ! __eou__  what seems to be the problem ? __eou__
 my computer just crashed again for the third time today ! __eou__  what were you doing when it crashed ? __eou__
 oh , no ! I thought it seemed a bit strange . __eou__  what kind of computer do you have , a Mac or a PC ? __eou__
 yes , they were horrible . We had to wear green every day ! __eou__  at least you didn't waste time thinking about what you were going to wear every day ! __eou__
 Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself . __eou__  Sure I would . __eou__
 Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? __eou__  I was just kidding . __eou__
 Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ’ s no Brian here . __eou__  Is this 777-9345 ? __eou__
 Oh , I ’ m so sorry . __eou__  That ’ s OK . __eou__
 Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now . __eou__  That ’ s okay . I ’ ll call back later . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry . We don't haven any . __eou__  But my sister bought this pair last month . __eou__
 I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ’ re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now . __eou__  They look very uncomfortable . __eou__
 He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone . __eou__  What did your boss say to him ? __eou__
 He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! " Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ’ t answer the phone ! __eou__  Did he telephone again last night ? __eou__
 I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ’ t telephone my daughter again ! __eou__  Did he telephone again ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . __eou__  What ? Are you serious ? __eou__
 Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . __eou__  No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . __eou__
 I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale . __eou__  Yes , they were thirty percent off . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items . __eou__  I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy . __eou__  I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here.Can you make an exception this time ? __eou__
 that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? __eou__  ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China . You know , in the past , people could not afford to eat out like they can today . __eou__
 I'm really sorry , Ethan . I tried so hard , but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town . The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here . __eou__  what ? I don't understand . __eou__
 I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know . __eou__  Didn't you learn that red means stop ? __eou__
 I'm sorry for the misunderstanding . __eou__  Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light . __eou__
Do you have any idea what time it is ? __eou__  My bad . I didn't realize that it was so late . __eou__
 My bad . I didn't realize that it was so late . __eou__  Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness ? __eou__
 That's true . My bad for not calling . __eou__  If you do this again , don't even bother coming home . __eou__
 If you do this again , don't even bother coming home . __eou__  You're going to kick me out over this ? __eou__
Do you know how late it is ? __eou__  My fault . I didn't realize what time it was . __eou__
 Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ? __eou__  This is true , but it must've slipped my mind . __eou__
 Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside . __eou__  You want to throw me out over this ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , but that's our only available time . __eou__  How about Saturday ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , but we're booked up on Friday . __eou__  Is Saturday any better ? __eou__
 I understand , and I am very sorry . __eou__  Here's your ticket . __eou__
 I'm sorry . That's the only available time . __eou__  Are you available this Saturday ? __eou__
 I will get right on that , and I am very sorry . __eou__  I really appreciate your help . __eou__
 That won't happen again , I'm sorry . __eou__  Thank you . Hopefully I won't have to call about him again . __eou__
 I apologize , and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again . __eou__  Don't worry about it , but thank you very much . __eou__
I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer . __eou__  I was able to contact them so , if you ’ ll step into my office , we ’ ll talk . __eou__
 I can't stand riding the bus . __eou__  Me too , it's so unreliable . __eou__
 Me too , it's so unreliable . __eou__  That is true . __eou__
 It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather . __eou__  Exactly.That ' s the worst part . __eou__
 Exactly.That ' s the worst part . __eou__  I think it's time we started driving . __eou__
 I really do hate public transportation . __eou__  I agree , it's just never on time . __eou__
 I agree , it's just never on time . __eou__  That's right . __eou__
 I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather . __eou__  Oh , that's the worst . __eou__
 Oh , that's the worst . __eou__  We need to get a car . __eou__
 There ’ s no way that I can stay here . __eou__  That ’ s not going to be all right . __eou__
 But I ’ m not able to live here anymore . __eou__  I can ’ t help you with that . __eou__
 You can ’ t just throw me out on the street ! __eou__  You have 30 days to catch up on your rent , or a sheriff will evict you . __eou__
 Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well . __eou__  Oh , I wouldn't worry about it . __eou__
 Oh , no , I'm afraid not . These things are just too old to guarantee anything . __eou__  I understand . __eou__
 Don ’ t tell me what to do ! I ’ ll get to it when I get around to it ! __eou__  If these problems are not addressed immediately , I will be contacting the health department this Friday and you will not get a rent check . __eou__
 I am maintaining the building . You are way too picky ! __eou__  Unfortunately , you won ’ t be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by Friday . __eou__
 I'm sorry . But at least we know which bus to catch to get back where we started . __eou__  Yeah , at least . __eou__
 I should not have listened to you . __eou__  I really thought this was our stop . __eou__
 I really thought this was our stop . __eou__  Now we have to walk . __eou__
 I should've just stayed on the bus . __eou__  I messed up . __eou__
 I messed up . __eou__  Great , we have to walk now . __eou__
 Why did you tell me to get off ? __eou__  I'm sorry . I thought this was our stop . __eou__
 I'm sorry . I thought this was our stop . __eou__  I really don't feel like walking . __eou__
 That's the last time I'm trusting you with the transportation . __eou__  My bad , but at least we know the right bus to take us back . __eou__
 The exam ! The terrible exam ! I'm not ready yet . Can you tell me how to get good marks ? __eou__  Don't be so nervous ! Relax ! First , sleep early at night . Second , study two hours a day after school . Third , don't tire yourself out , but don't be lazy . Will that help ? __eou__
 I've been through a lot today . I forgot to set my alarm clock last night , so I woke up late this morning . And what is worse , I missed the school bus . __eou__  That's enough . Sit down . __eou__
 I have already known that . I didn't get the scholarship , right ? __eou__  Yes . The board was favorably impressed with your application , but the competition was very fierce . __eou__
 Can you help me ? You know I do need the scholarship . __eou__  I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year . __eou__
 I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ? __eou__  I'll do my best . __eou__
 There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it . __eou__  Why ? We can leave school earlier that day . __eou__
 I didn't do well in last exams . If my father knows it , he will beat me up . __eou__  I can't believe it . My parents never beat me . __eou__
 You know that my father is irritable . __eou__  You can ask the teacher for help . __eou__
 Oh , Steven , I made a big mistake . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 I really wish I hadn ’ t done it . __eou__  What on earth are you talking about ? __eou__
 I got caught cheating . I feel so ashamed . The teacher saw me and told me I failed . __eou__  What were you thinking ? __eou__
 You know my father . If I fail , he'll kill me . I have to do well . __eou__  But what you should do is study hard . __eou__
 I know ... I know ... it's all my fault . I feel awful that I didn ’ t study , and I cheated , and I got caught . __eou__  So long as you learn from your mistakes . __eou__
 Wow ! __eou__  Mr . : Furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves . __eou__
 Cindy , I'm scared . __eou__  But I have to go to my homeroom . __eou__
 I thought so . I felt dizzy this morning . __eou__  You should've called in sick ! Next time , have either of your parents call the school office . __eou__
 Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow . __eou__  Really ! __eou__
 Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here . __eou__  Mm , so what are you going to miss about Japan ? __eou__
 I doubt if I can pass it . __eou__  Don't be so worried , You know Professor Robert is not too strict . __eou__
 But I often skip his classes , and he doesn't like me . __eou__  I hope you'll do better in the final . __eou__
 Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done . __eou__  I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing . __eou__
 I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing . __eou__  Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me . __eou__
 I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ? __eou__  Well , English is a " paper tiger " . Its natural enemy is adequate practice . __eou__
 I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words . __eou__  I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language . __eou__
I have two finals this week and one oral presentation and I'm not ready for any of them ! __eou__  Sounds like you will be doing some serious cramming till Friday ! __eou__
 After six months , my college life will come to the end . The following trouble will be the job-hunting . That's really a headache . __eou__  Do not take things so seriously , my pal ! Every one of us will face the trouble and job-hunting is inevitable . Take it easy ! Believe in yourself and some day you will be successful . __eou__
 Well , I confess . I did it , because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill . I'm ashamed that I did that . __eou__  Return the money to Jim and make an apology . I think he will forgive you . __eou__
I'm so nervous about this oral test . __eou__  Just calm down . I'm sure you'll do well . __eou__
 My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . __eou__  Did you finish typing it yesterday ? __eou__
 Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . __eou__  Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? __eou__
 Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . __eou__  How about the shelf ? __eou__
 I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? __eou__  Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . __eou__
 I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? __eou__  Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? __eou__
Emily , what kind of report is this ? __eou__  What do you mean , Mr . Smith ? You said to make it brief . __eou__
Uh-oh . I'm in trouble . __eou__  Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__
 I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it . __eou__  I guess you'll have to wing it . __eou__
 Just get out of my face ! __eou__  Woo , easy . __eou__
 Leave me alone ! __eou__  What are you so ticked off about ? __eou__
 Don't brother me ! __eou__  Hey , chill out , I'm just trying to help . __eou__
 Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault . __eou__  So , what's the problem ? __eou__
 I drew a blank on the algebra test . __eou__  No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? __eou__
 Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . __eou__  That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester . __eou__
 I'm thinking of dropping out . __eou__  You can't do that , Jenny ! __eou__
 I'm dead serious about this , Sally . __eou__  Come on , let's talk about it . __eou__
Oh , my god . How can you stand living in such a messy dorm ? __eou__  Our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others . __eou__
 Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ? __eou__  In fact , I just swept the floor three days ago . __eou__
I wish the teacher wouldn't make us read this book . __eou__  Yeah . It's boring . I'd rather read something more exciting . __eou__
I'm frustrated . __eou__  What's the problem ? __eou__
 I can't work out this problem . __eou__  Let me take a look . Maybe I can figure it out . __eou__
 Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . __eou__  You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report . __eou__
 Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . __eou__  It just happened to be the highest grade in the class . __eou__
 You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it . __eou__  I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade . __eou__
 Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now . __eou__  Why ? What happened ? __eou__
 School . Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out . __eou__  The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright . __eou__
 Well . I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam . __eou__  Why are you so pessimistic ? __eou__
 I'm not being pessimistic . I'm being realistic . My chemistry is so bad . __eou__  I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . Don't lose your heart . __eou__
I failed the exam because I didn't study . __eou__  Serves you right . __eou__
 Well , it would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me . __eou__  Sorry ! __eou__
 I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . __eou__  What happened ? You look so pale . __eou__
 It's the end of the world for me . __eou__  What makes you say that ? __eou__
 Today , I'm told I failed three courses . __eou__  Oh , that's too bad . Work harder next term . __eou__
 B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me . __eou__  Don't lose heart . Everything will be fine . __eou__
 Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . __eou__  Well , what's your excuse then ? __eou__
 Oh , the final exam is coming soon . I feel a little bit nervous . __eou__  Take it easy . There is still one more week left before the exam begins . Have you prepared for it well ? __eou__
 Are all lucky people so stuck up ? __eou__  C'mon , don't take it seriously ! I'm just kidding . __eou__
You know ... I did very poorly on that test . __eou__  Cheer up ! It's not the only chance in life to do well on a test . There'll be many more . __eou__
 Well , you know how I am about exams . I'm a perfectionist . __eou__  Don't worry about it . All in all , you've done very well in school . __eou__
I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . __eou__  Have you tried university part-time jobs ? __eou__
 I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . __eou__  Anyway , there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York . __eou__
 I already had that idea . __eou__  Well , why don't you go and look down there ? __eou__
 I am very grateful for your advice . __eou__  It's my pleasure to talk with you . __eou__
I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on . __eou__  Where there are difficulties , there are ways to get over them . Hold on ! __eou__
 Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . __eou__  That's a problem . __eou__
 It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . __eou__  But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? __eou__
 Whatever am i going to tell me parents . __eou__  Don't worry about that , I am sure they will understand . After all , it was a very difficult exam . __eou__
 What a pity ! I missed it again . __eou__  It's popular you know . You want to reserve it ? __eou__
 I don't know . I failed my exam . __eou__  What did you get ? __eou__
 No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know . __eou__  I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ? __eou__
 I feel very nervous about it . __eou__  Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . __eou__
 But I still get stuck on the different tones . It drives me crazy . __eou__  Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . __eou__
 I am pretty sure that I am in trouble . __eou__  I can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ? __eou__
 I hate school ! __eou__  why ? What happened ? __eou__
 I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today ! __eou__  it's just one exam . Can you re-take the exam ? __eou__
 yes , but it's so humiliating ! I don't want my friends to know I failed ! __eou__  why didn't you do a good job ? __eou__
 Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well . __eou__  Oh , I wouldn't worry about it . __eou__
 Just get out of my face ! __eou__  Woo , easy . __eou__
 Leave me alone ! __eou__  What are you so ticked off about ? __eou__
 Don't brother me ! __eou__  Hey , Chillon , I'm just trying to help . __eou__
 it was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . __eou__  how could it be ? __eou__
 I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . __eou__  I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! __eou__
 Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them . __eou__  These magazines are interesting . May I borrow one ? __eou__
 I hate spending too much time at home . I get bored of it really quickly . I ’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people . __eou__  perhaps I ’ m being too shy . I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests ! __eou__
 Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__  I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__
 Www , man ! __eou__  In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . __eou__
 Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! __eou__  Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . __eou__
I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . __eou__  Calm down . __eou__
 NYU was my first choice . __eou__  I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in . __eou__  I ’ ll just have to wait for UCLA . __eou__
 She never cares about others . __eou__  It ’ s true . Guess what we were talking about last night . __eou__
 To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course I'ever had . __eou__  How could you manage to pass the exam ? __eou__
I'm afraid of the darkness . __eou__  Don't worry . I'll drive you back . __eou__
My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . __eou__  After all , he is a baby . __eou__
 I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__  That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__
 I really want to take him over my knee . __eou__  No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . __eou__
I've had enough of that ! __eou__  Why , this is the most interesting film ! __eou__
 I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . __eou__  But it's only a film . __eou__
 Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! __eou__  Yes , my customers have started to complain too ! __eou__
Mark is parade his knowledge again . __eou__  Yeah ! He ’ s very good at showing off his knowledge . __eou__
 That ’ s too much . __eou__  Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . __eou__
I'm busy year in and year out , but now I've done nothing . __eou__  You've done a lot , my darling ! __eou__
 I may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction . __eou__  You're too strict with yourself . __eou__
 He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death . __eou__  Don't you like to know anything about stocks ? __eou__
 I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . __eou__  Don ’ t pretend you are a good God . __eou__
 You should feel shameful for your behavior . __eou__  I've never experienced such a kind of feeling . __eou__
It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . __eou__  Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway . __eou__
 What fools we were ! __eou__  To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me . __eou__
 What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves . __eou__  I hardly dare call the police . They'll just laugh at us . __eou__
 I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? __eou__  And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . __eou__
 It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game . __eou__  How come ? __eou__
 I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again . __eou__  I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart . __eou__
Joan is a thorough drag ! __eou__  What is it ? __eou__
Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . __eou__  Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . __eou__
 You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . __eou__  Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . __eou__
 She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ? __eou__  But I am her brother , not her servant . __eou__
I have a bone to pick with you . __eou__  Okay . Let ’ s clear the air . What are you getting at ? __eou__
 You always have a chip on your shoulder . __eou__  I ’ m sorry . But I don ’ t meant to get your goat . __eou__
 He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! __eou__  I don't think so . He only had no common sense . __eou__
I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow . __eou__  It's no use arguing the toss . __eou__
 How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . __eou__  But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . __eou__
My hair stood on end when I saw the bloody scene . __eou__  What scene ? __eou__
My father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold . __eou__  You mean that he is bad-tempered and often gets angry with you . __eou__
 Oh , thank God . We all felt frightened by the bad new about him . __eou__  Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital . __eou__
I ’ m itching for moving ! __eou__  What ’ s the matter ? What annoy you ? __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry . __eou__  It kept me awake a couple of hours . __eou__
 I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud . __eou__  It was that loud , and it was pretty late , and check with Mary if you don't believe me . __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__  What is it ? What happened ? __eou__
 I think someone is stalking me . __eou__  No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__  Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__
 Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__  Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__
Ah ! No ! Damn it ! __eou__  It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . __eou__
 So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . __eou__  Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? __eou__
 I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . __eou__  What are we going to do now ? __eou__
 Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . __eou__  I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . __eou__
Bob , I'm really upset with you . __eou__  I'm sorry , I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary . __eou__
 I'm sorry , I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary . __eou__  You forgot it last year as well . __eou__
 You forgot it last year as well . __eou__  I know , I'm sorry . __eou__
 It is impossible . You cheated on me . __eou__  No , listen to me . I always regard you as my best friend . I admire you , and of course you've helped me so much . I should thank you . __eou__
 Shut up ! __eou__  No , listen to me . Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well . Maybe in other people's eyes , I want you to be my girl-friend . but ... but ... __eou__
 But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't . __eou__  OK ... OK ... Anyway . I will treat you as my best friend . I hope you can do the same . __eou__
How could you have done that without asking me first ? __eou__  I didn't realize you felt so strongly about it . __eou__
 Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ? __eou__  Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too . __eou__
 I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life ! __eou__  I think we can still talk . __eou__
 No way ! Please don't follow me around . __eou__  Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ? __eou__
I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . __eou__  Oh , that's all right . __eou__
 I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow . __eou__  No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that . __eou__
I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble . __eou__  That's all right . __eou__
I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . __eou__  But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z . __eou__
I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . __eou__  It was me . I am so sorry . __eou__
 What did you think you were doing ? __eou__  I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__
 I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__  How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__
 How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__  I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__
 I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__  Never do that again . __eou__
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? __eou__  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__
 Yeah . I get sick of her . She always bends my ear about what she thinks . __eou__  She is a barking dog . But she means well . __eou__
I dislike Susan . She is always above herself . __eou__  Don ’ t you know that she was the only one who had received the invitation in the office ? __eou__
 Nothing . I just feel very lonely in this city . I miss my family . __eou__  Oh , I know . Sometimes I have the same feeling with you . But you'd better not be so emotional . __eou__
 I just watched a movie and I'm scared . __eou__  What did you watch ? __eou__
 My friend and I was argued with each other . For this , I ’ m very sad . Because I don ’ t want to lose this friend . __eou__  Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I know how you feel . Please don ’ t be sad . __eou__
 Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I know how you feel . Please don ’ t be sad . __eou__  Thank you , but I really want to relax myself . I ’ m very sorry . __eou__
 Thank you , but I really want to relax myself . I ’ m very sorry . __eou__  OK . Don ’ t let it get to you . Goodbye . __eou__
 Just get out of my face , would you ? __eou__  Chill out ! What's eating you , anyway ? __eou__
 Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? __eou__  She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too . __eou__
 Get out of here ! __eou__  I'm dead serious . Yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes , ‘ Good morning , Jim . ’ __eou__
 You ! __eou__  What are you talking about ? What did I do ? __eou__
 You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? __eou__  No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends . __eou__
 I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . __eou__  Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you . __eou__
 Waiter ! __eou__  Yes , sir . I'll bring your drink right away . __eou__
 I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . __eou__  I'm really sorry . __eou__
 I am not in the mood . __eou__  Why are you feeling depress ? __eou__
 But she did and it made me disappointed . __eou__  Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__
You ’ re making my blood boil . __eou__  Calm down . Madam . __eou__
 I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter . __eou__  I am very sorry to hear that you ’ Ve been having so many problems . __eou__
 Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ? __eou__  I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out . __eou__
 Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! __eou__  If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out . __eou__
Look what you've done ! __eou__  I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately . __eou__
 Yes , and hurry up ! __eou__  I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ? __eou__
 I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble . __eou__  Yes , and please be more careful in the future ! __eou__
 Yes , and please be more careful in the future ! __eou__  I will , sir . I'm really very sorry . __eou__
 I will , sir . I'm really very sorry . __eou__  That's OK . __eou__
 I really wanted to get into NYU . __eou__  I am really sorry to hear that . __eou__
 I am really sorry to hear that . __eou__  It ’ s okay . I ’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway . __eou__
 I had high hopes for NYU . __eou__  I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted . __eou__  Hopefully , I ’ ll get accepted to UCLA . __eou__
 That's crossing the line . __eou__  Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ? __eou__
 Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . __eou__  Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . __eou__
 As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
Oh , no ! __eou__  How dreadful ! __eou__
 How dreadful ! __eou__  Look at the view from the window . __eou__
 Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected . __eou__  It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? __eou__
 It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? __eou__  I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed . __eou__
 I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed . __eou__  It can ’ t be helped . __eou__
 I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow . __eou__  OK , but don't forget I'm here for you , and I know how you feel . It's my loss , too . __eou__
 I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! __eou__  But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you ! __eou__
 Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! __eou__  What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? __eou__
 Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! __eou__  So he talks about you behind your back ? __eou__
 Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! __eou__  I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__  I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__
 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__  Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__
 I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? __eou__  I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . __eou__
 It's really very easy saying you're sorry . __eou__  Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . __eou__
 I just lost my job . My boss just told me . __eou__  That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? __eou__
 I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . __eou__  I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . __eou__
When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . __eou__  The last straw , huh ? __eou__
 Yes , he's really pushed me too far . __eou__  I know what you mean . __eou__
You didn't tell me she was married ! __eou__  I tried . You were preoccupied . __eou__
 I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! __eou__  You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up . __eou__
 My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . __eou__  No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ? __eou__
Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look ! __eou__  What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line . __eou__
 No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! __eou__  You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want . __eou__
It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you . __eou__  Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ... __eou__
 Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ... __eou__  This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ... __eou__
 This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ... __eou__  I'll tell you all about it another day . __eou__
 I'll tell you all about it another day . __eou__  But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ? __eou__
 It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . __eou__  But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . __eou__
 Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . __eou__  This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five . __eou__
 Copycat ! __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 You went out and bought khakis , too ! __eou__  No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki . __eou__
 I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . __eou__  Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . __eou__
 That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__  Was I ? Sorry , I didn't mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__
 And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__  Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
 I ’ m not in the mood . __eou__  Why are you feeling depressed ? __eou__
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . __eou__  I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . __eou__
 But she did and made me disappointed . __eou__  Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__
 But she means a lot to me . __eou__  Then forgive her mistake . __eou__
 I hate it . __eou__  Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . __eou__
 The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . __eou__  Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! __eou__
 Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! __eou__  I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? __eou__
 I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? __eou__  You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? __eou__
 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? __eou__  Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . __eou__
 Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . __eou__  Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . __eou__
 Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . __eou__  Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? __eou__
 But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ... __eou__  I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service . __eou__
 This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone . __eou__  I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock . __eou__
Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now ! __eou__  Is everything OK ? __eou__
 Just get over here ! __eou__  Come in ! Quickly ! __eou__
 Come in ! Quickly ! __eou__  So , since when is your house a bank ? __eou__
 Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . __eou__  What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? __eou__
 Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . __eou__  OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? __eou__
It smells like an ashtray in here ! __eou__  Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? __eou__
 What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . __eou__  No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! __eou__
 Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . __eou__  I know , I know . I am really trying , but I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? __eou__
 I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! __eou__  How dare you speak to me like this . __eou__
 The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . __eou__  But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? __eou__
Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . __eou__  Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . __eou__
 You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . __eou__  Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . __eou__
 But I always feel disappointed . I have many problems with English learning . __eou__  Honey , cheer up . __eou__
 I feel confused about the grammars . __eou__  I'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best . __eou__
 And my writing is not good . I feel so frustrated . __eou__  Be confident , and never give up . __eou__
 I know that , mom . But sometimes I'm just sad . __eou__  Keep your chin up . Remember ? Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . __eou__
I don't know what I can do now . I'm down and out . __eou__  You are not the gray train , I guess . But bite the bullet and you'll soon be in the chips again . __eou__
 I hope so . But I'm always caught short . __eou__  But the darkest hour is the nearest dawn . I bet you'll soon turn the table . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__  Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? __eou__  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__
 I didn't really like it . __eou__  Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . __eou__
 I found it very disappointing . __eou__  She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . __eou__
 I wasn't happy with it . __eou__  Nothing is to your satisfaction . __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__  What a shame ! __eou__
 I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__  That's too bad . __eou__
 Then my son drove into a tree __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__
 The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__  What a pity ! __eou__
 And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__  Ho , no ! __eou__
 Whatever am i going to tell me parents . __eou__  Don't worry about that , I am sure they will understand . After all , it was a very difficult exam . __eou__
 Stay away from me . __eou__  Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ? __eou__
 I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . __eou__  That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry . __eou__
 I'll have us ready for Stars.com by the end of next week . After that , I don't know . __eou__  Don't know what ? __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__  I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__
 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__  Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__
 I'm sorry . I forget all about it . __eou__  How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . __eou__
 How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . __eou__  It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . __eou__
 It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . __eou__  I have been looking forward to this performance all month . __eou__
 I have been looking forward to this performance all month . __eou__  I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . __eou__
You didn't ring me last night.You said you would . __eou__  I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__
 That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__  Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__
 And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__  Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already . __eou__  If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop . __eou__
 I did . But they said they won ’ t change them . __eou__  That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do . __eou__
 I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . __eou__  Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . __eou__
 I ’ m not in the mood . __eou__  Why are you feeling depressed ? __eou__
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . __eou__  I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . __eou__
 But she did and made me disappointed . __eou__  Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__
 But she means a lot to me . __eou__  Then forgive her mistake . __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__  What a shame ! __eou__
 I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__  That's too bad . __eou__
What a terrible house ! __eou__  I'm sick of it , too . __eou__
 I'm sick of it , too . __eou__  The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . __eou__
 The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . __eou__  It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . __eou__
 How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . __eou__  But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . __eou__
 Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__  I thought we were supposed to meet HERE . __eou__
 Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__  I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . __eou__
 Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__  You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__
I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__  Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__
They promised us a sea view . __eou__  Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . __eou__
 Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__  Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . __eou__
 I don ’ t want to . __eou__  Well , come and talk to me then . __eou__
 Certainly not . __eou__  May I turn on the radio then ? __eou__
 Turn on the radio ? What for ? __eou__  So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__
 Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ? __eou__  Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . __eou__
 Oh , breaktime flies . __eou__  Come on , baby . It ’ s time now . __eou__
It's terrible how things have changed.You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . __eou__  Really ? There aren't many left now . __eou__
 I sure did . __eou__  You ought to complain.These machine are always out of order . __eou__
You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! __eou__  Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . __eou__
 Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . __eou__  They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . __eou__
 They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . __eou__  They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . __eou__
 They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . __eou__  You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! __eou__

I don't think the lecture is very interesting . __eou__  The lecturer is dull , too . __eou__
 The lecturer is dull , too . __eou__  I feel he's like a talking machine . __eou__
 I feel he's like a talking machine . __eou__  I feel the same way . __eou__
Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? __eou__  Yeah , I'm afraid so . __eou__
 Yeah , I'm afraid so . __eou__  If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . __eou__
 If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . __eou__  Yes , it is annoying . __eou__
I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time __eou__  Well , I must apologize , madam . We have new computers here , you know . __eou__
 Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ? __eou__  I agree entirely . I assure you it won't happen again . __eou__
Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie . __eou__  Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one . __eou__
 Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one . __eou__  Why are we watching it anyway ? __eou__
Did you hear what she said to me ? __eou__  I heard it . __eou__
 What do you think I should do about it ? __eou__  Just let it be . Her rudeness will come back to haunt her . __eou__
 I don ’ t really like Henry . I like my Rose . __eou__  I don ’ t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ’ m going to marry him . __eou__
 I don ’ t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ’ m going to marry him . __eou__  But my Rose is great . __eou__
 Your Rose is a fool . __eou__  Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible . __eou__
 Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible . __eou__  Why don ’ t you marry Rose , then ? __eou__
Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ? __eou__  Well , Mr . King is singing . __eou__
 You don ’ t love me , Roy . __eou__  Why do you say such words ? I love you very much . __eou__
 No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . __eou__  Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s . __eou__
 I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . __eou__  Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply . __eou__
 Oh , shut up , Roy . __eou__  But honey , I think you ’ re terrific . There is nothing ... __eou__
She is so stupid . __eou__  Who cares ? She is pretty . __eou__
 So what ? __eou__  You're just jealous . __eou__
 But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . __eou__  I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? __eou__
 It ’ s getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . __eou__  leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__
 You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . __eou__  How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? __eou__
 He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . __eou__  Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . __eou__
 He never came . __eou__  He stood you up . __eou__
 I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? __eou__  Not possible . __eou__
How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ? __eou__  I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it . __eou__
I don ’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food . __eou__  I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired . __eou__
 I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired . __eou__  Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself . __eou__
 Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself . __eou__  Have you found anything yet ? __eou__
 Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late . __eou__  Yes , But I couldn ’ t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another . __eou__
 why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__  Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters . __eou__
 Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ? __eou__  Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry . __eou__
 Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry . __eou__  Well . You ’ re here . __eou__
So , this is the worst story I ’ Ve heard this month . You have my real sympathy , Tim . __eou__  You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way . __eou__
 You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way . __eou__  I understand how you feel , but you ’ Ve gotta learn to move on . __eou__
 Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . __eou__  It ’ s a sad thing . I ’ m ever so sorry ... __eou__
I just got laid off . The awful business , you know . __eou__  I ’ m very sorry to hear about that . So are you all right ? __eou__
 Yeah , I ’ m better after talking to you . __eou__  Oh , you poor thing ! __eou__
Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? __eou__  I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . __eou__
 Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that . __eou__  Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . __eou__
I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . __eou__  It was me . I am so sorry . __eou__
 What did you think you were doing ? __eou__  I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__
 How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__  I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__
 I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__  Never do that again . __eou__
 I don't want to . __eou__  Well , come over and talk to me then . __eou__
 Certainly not . __eou__  May I turn on the TV then ? __eou__
 Turn on the TV for what ? __eou__  So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__
 Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? __eou__  I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . __eou__
Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge . __eou__  Oh , How annoying ! __eou__
 What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . __eou__  My mother was ill . I had to look after her . __eou__
 Well , I hate to have to say this , but I'm not happy with my room . __eou__  Oh , what exactly is problem ? __eou__
 Yes , it's my steak . __eou__  What's wrong with it , sir ? __eou__
 It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . __eou__  I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ? __eou__
I hate to see the abuse of animals . __eou__  It makes me sick . __eou__
I really dislike reading academic books . __eou__  That may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge . __eou__
I really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive ! __eou__  Just tell the truth . I won ’ t take it personally . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__  Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__
 But you should tell me you were in love with her . __eou__  Didn't I ? __eou__
 You know you didn't . __eou__  Well , I am telling you now . __eou__
 Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__  I didn't think you would be interested . __eou__
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? __eou__  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__
 I am not in the mood . __eou__  Why are you feeling depress ? __eou__
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . __eou__  I don't think she would do such a thing . __eou__
 But she did and it made me disappointed . __eou__  Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__
 But she means a lot to me . __eou__  Then forgive her mistake . __eou__
I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . __eou__  You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . __eou__
 How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . __eou__  It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . __eou__
 It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . __eou__  Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . __eou__
 Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . __eou__  What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . __eou__
 I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty . __eou__  I'm very sorry.sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . __eou__
 That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? __eou__  I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . __eou__
Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour ! __eou__  Sorry , madam . You have to wait your turn . The parking lot is full . __eou__
 Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! __eou__  I'm sure a spot will open up soon . __eou__
 And let them ruin my life ? Forget it ! __eou__  But you've been looking for that stamp for years . __eou__
 Bummer . I guess we're both out of luck . __eou__  Yeah . Well , I'll see you this weekend . __eou__
 I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip . __eou__  Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ? __eou__
 But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . __eou__  At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day . __eou__
 Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . __eou__  Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this . __eou__
 Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . __eou__  Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . __eou__
 She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? __eou__  Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . __eou__
What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . __eou__  Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . __eou__
 My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . __eou__  It is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__
 You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . __eou__  No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__
 Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__  Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__
What a terrible house ! __eou__  I'm sick of it , too . __eou__
 I'm sick of it , too . __eou__  The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! __eou__
 The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! __eou__  It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! __eou__
I'm scared that she might not come back . __eou__  No , I don't think she's that strong-minded . __eou__
 But she took her luggage away with her . __eou__  She will be back soon.You can wait and see . __eou__
I'm worried sick that she might leave me one day . __eou__  I'll teach you how to keep her . __eou__
I don't know what to do , if I can't find the money . __eou__  Don't worry yourself too much . __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__  I feel the same way . __eou__
 I feel the same way . __eou__  It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__
 It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__  It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . __eou__
To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . __eou__  To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . __eou__
 To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . __eou__  How could you manage to pass the exam ? __eou__
I was scared stiff of giving my first performance . __eou__  Were you ? your performance was excellent . __eou__
 No , I'm scared of cats . __eou__  Oh , but why ? __eou__
 Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . __eou__  Yes , I agree , but still a lot of people watch it . __eou__
 Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! ! __eou__  Oh , come on ! I just gave them my e-mail , my address and my phone number . And my name , of course . __eou__
 We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! __eou__  But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers . __eou__
I'll never ever work together with him ! __eou__  What happened ? Quarrel again ? __eou__
 Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! __eou__  Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . __eou__
 What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! __eou__  Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . __eou__
Reciting texts really bores me to death . __eou__  Do you have to remember every text ? __eou__
I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . __eou__  Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . __eou__
I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore . __eou__  Young people enjoy pop songs more . __eou__
 It's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all . __eou__  But you don't have such a problem as to pop songs . __eou__
What a boring film ! __eou__  The acting of the heroine is too artificial . __eou__
 The acting of the heroine is too artificial . __eou__  And the plot is so simple . __eou__
What a bother having to climb storeys home every day . __eou__  But it's also a sort of exercise and it's good to your health . __eou__
 I don't care ! __eou__  You're complaining again . __eou__
I must admit I'm not at all interested in math . __eou__  I'm sure you'll soon begin to like it.It ' s such an interesting subject . __eou__
 Sorry to trouble you . But I don't think this fish is fresh . It actually tastes a bit off . __eou__  Sorry , Miss . I'll place it immediately , can I get you another drink , or you wait ? __eou__
That guy's manner really turns me off . __eou__  Yeah.He never stops asking questions . __eou__
All the routine work really browns me off . __eou__  Oh , come on.You ' Ve just started . __eou__
That woman is a thorough drag ! __eou__  What is it ? __eou__
 She keeps spitting on the ground . __eou__  Maybe there's something wrong with her . __eou__
 I'm fed up with his endless talking . __eou__  You can't say that ! He's a very knowledgeable person . __eou__
 I don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__  It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . __eou__
 To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__  Why ? What happened ? __eou__
 Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__  That's not very fair . What did you do ? __eou__
 There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . __eou__  Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__
 He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__  Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__
 I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__  Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? __eou__
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! __eou__  Why ? What are they like ? __eou__
 They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! __eou__  Have you ever talked to them about it ? __eou__
 I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! __eou__  What did they say ? __eou__
 They both just talk about how great they are all the time . __eou__  They soud like the neighbours from hell ! __eou__
 They soud like the neighbours from hell ! __eou__  They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . __eou__
 They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . __eou__  I thought you didn't talk to them much . __eou__
 I can't afford to move right now . __eou__  Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . __eou__
 I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand . __eou__  Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? __eou__
 That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? __eou__  That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident . __eou__
I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad . __eou__  He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon . __eou__
Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard . __eou__  I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . __eou__
 I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . __eou__  How come ? __eou__
 It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . __eou__  I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? __eou__
Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers . __eou__  Dear , don ’ t worry . The police can help you . __eou__
It ’ s dangerous . I don ’ t dare to go . __eou__  Come on . It ’ s quite safe . You really have no guts . __eou__
Hey , Cindy , I ’ m so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone . __eou__  Don ’ t worry about it . __eou__
 I don ’ t know what happened to me . I just lost it . __eou__  I think you just need to get more sleep . __eou__
 my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend ! __eou__  your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he ? __eou__
 you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work ! __eou__  that's not just your boss . No one is allowed to send personal emails from the office . __eou__
 I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . __eou__  it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . __eou__
I love her so much , you know . I want to be alone . Please keep quiet . __eou__  I am just casting pearls before swine . __eou__
 well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . __eou__  I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! __eou__
You are freaking me out . __eou__  You don ’ t like the dog ? I promise I will never bring it with me ! __eou__
It smells like an ashtray in here ! __eou__  Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? __eou__
 What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . __eou__  No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! __eou__
 Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . __eou__  I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? __eou__
 I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . __eou__  Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . __eou__
 Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . __eou__  Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . __eou__
 But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation . __eou__  I know why we have reservations . __eou__
 I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . __eou__  But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like . __eou__
 Fine . I ’ ll take the compact . __eou__  Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? __eou__
Look at what you have done . All thumbs . __eou__  I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__  What ? What did you buy ? __eou__
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__  What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__
 For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? __eou__  Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . __eou__
 We ’ re doomed ! __eou__  There is some really good news though ! __eou__
 oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . __eou__  what ' the matter ? __eou__
 the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . __eou__  I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . __eou__
 Steven ! What ’ s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ’ t know you have a gun ! What ’ s going on ! __eou__  I will come clean as soon as we get to safety , OK ? For now , you have to trust me , please ! I would never do anything to hurt you . __eou__
 Steven , I ... __eou__  I haven ’ t been completely honest with you Veronica , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not a fireman . I ’ m not even from the United States . I ’ m a spy for the Indian government . __eou__
 What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me ! __eou__  I ’ m sorry , I wasn ’ t supposed to meet you . I wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car ! __eou__  Veronica , wait ! __eou__
Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long __eou__  It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . __eou__
 Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . __eou__  Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__
 My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! __eou__  Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__  What ? What did you buy ? __eou__
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__  What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__  What is it ? What happened ? __eou__
 I think someone is stalking me . __eou__  No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__
 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__  What did you do ? __eou__
 I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__  Did he leave when you left ? __eou__
 He followed me all the way home ! __eou__  That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__  Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__
 Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__  Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! __eou__  So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? __eou__
 That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! __eou__  Have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__
 Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? __eou__  You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__
 I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! __eou__  And Merry Christmas ! __eou__
 Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! __eou__  I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? __eou__
 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? __eou__  Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . __eou__
The mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__  Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . __eou__
 Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . __eou__  Do you have any bug spray ? __eou__
 Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . __eou__  Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! __eou__
Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . __eou__  Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . __eou__
 Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . __eou__  I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . __eou__
 You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore __eou__  Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . __eou__
 Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints . __eou__  My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? __eou__
 well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . __eou__  terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . __eou__
 now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . __eou__  really ? What happened ? __eou__
 I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? __eou__  you know she probably feels just as bad . __eou__
 well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . __eou__  well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . __eou__
 Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! __eou__  Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . __eou__  What were the odds ? __eou__
 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! __eou__  Too bad . __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__  What is it ? What happened ? __eou__
 I think someone is stalking me . __eou__  No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__
 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__  What did you do ? __eou__

 Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__  What did you do ? __eou__
He followed me all the way home ! __eou__  That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there .

And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__
 Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__  Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__
 I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__  Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__
I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing ! __eou__  Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__  What ? What did you buy ? __eou__
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__  What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__
 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__  And ? __eou__
I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here . __eou__  License and registration please . Have you been drinking tonight , sir ? __eou__
I've just been a little depressed lately . __eou__  What's wrong ? __eou__
 Nothing really . __eou__  Then just keep your chin up . __eou__
It's taking you forever to do my hair . __eou__  Give me a minute . __eou__
 You should've been done already . __eou__  There you go . __eou__
 I don't think that you're done . __eou__  What's wrong ? __eou__
 My hair looks hideous . __eou__  What's so bad about it ? __eou__
 It doesn't look good at all . __eou__  Sorry about that . __eou__
 I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . __eou__  Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ? __eou__
I lost all my lottery winnings playing the stock market . __eou__  Easy come , easy go . __eou__
I'm terribly nervous . __eou__  Calm down ! __eou__
I'm tired of this job . __eou__  So am I . __eou__
My uncle passed away last night . __eou__  My condolences . __eou__
My girlfriend dumped me . __eou__  Well , that's life . __eou__
My uncle passed away last night . __eou__  My condolences . __eou__
It's all over . I'm bankrupt . __eou__  Don't worry . Everything will be fine . __eou__
You're spending a very long time on my hair . __eou__  I'm almost done . __eou__
 Are you sure you're finished ? __eou__  I don't understand . __eou__
 You did a horrible job on my hair . __eou__  What's wrong with it ? __eou__
 I don't like anything about it . __eou__  I apologize . __eou__
 I think there's more you need to do . __eou__  What do you mean by that ? __eou__
 My hair looks awful . __eou__  What don't you like about it ? __eou__
 I just don't like my hair . __eou__  I'm sorry that you don't like it . __eou__
 I won't be paying you for this . __eou__  I'm sure we can work something out . __eou__
 That sounds absolutely disgusting ! __eou__  It was . Let's stick with the regular choices today , though . __eou__
 I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . __eou__  How come ? __eou__
 It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . __eou__  I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? __eou__
 I think that would be horrible ! __eou__  I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today ! __eou__
 I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now . Miss , I just checked with the kitchen , and they said your order will be coming right up next . Oh , here comes . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Miss , I'm very sorry for the delay , please enjoy this . Free a glass of wine for inconvenience . Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long . __eou__  It doesn't matter . __eou__
I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . __eou__  What's the big deal ? __eou__
Dad , I'm scared . __eou__  Take it easy , honey . It's just raining cats and dogs . __eou__
 But , dad , it's stormy outside . __eou__  Honey , it's just windy and raining outside . __eou__
 Oh , that scared me . __eou__  The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake . __eou__
 Oh , dear ! How ruthless ! __eou__  Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ? __eou__
 Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had . __eou__  Why ? What happened ? __eou__
 It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . __eou__  So how long did you stay ? __eou__
This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time . __eou__  I won't do it again . Please forgive me . __eou__
 I won't do it again . Please forgive me . __eou__  No way . I've given you too many chances already . __eou__
My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it . __eou__  Maybe you two should go see a marriage counselor . __eou__
How annoying ! __eou__  What's the matter ? __eou__
I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! __eou__  God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? __eou__
I hate this kind of weather ! __eou__  When I was a kid , there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather . __eou__
 I think he had water on the brain . This is bad . __eou__  He said there are only all kinds of good weather . __eou__
You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are ! __eou__  Give me a chance to explain . I was no my way and I had an accident . __eou__
 Sure . You look like you're all black and blue . __eou__  I am fine . In fact , I don't have a scratch on me or my vehicle . But the other guy is in critical condition . __eou__
 Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert . __eou__  I guess I misjudged you . I hope you can forgive me . __eou__
 My girlfriend just broke up with me . __eou__  You must feel terrible now . __eou__
 Yeah . __eou__  I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too . __eou__
 But it hurts too much . __eou__  I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . __eou__
 My grandmother just passed away . __eou__  I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ? __eou__
 A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral . __eou__  Is there anything I can do ? __eou__
 No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time . __eou__  I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ? __eou__
 Jake just broke up with me . __eou__  I'm sorry . When did this happen ? __eou__
 Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else . __eou__  What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you . __eou__
 But it still hurts . I thought I loved him . __eou__  He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better . __eou__
 Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him __eou__  It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week . __eou__
 I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive . __eou__  Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping . __eou__
 Well , I just saw a horror movie last night . It almost frightened me to death . __eou__  Well , we could see something different like a detective film . __eou__
 Stop talking about her . She gives me goose bumps . I never wish to be in her sight . __eou__  She is pretty . Many men praise her highly . __eou__
 Don ’ t be kidding , OK ? __eou__  What ’ s the matter ? So angry . I ’ m just playing a joke with you . __eou__
Watch out , Patrick ! __eou__  Whew ! Thanks , Karen . That car almost hit me . __eou__
 I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more . __eou__  Did you just get your review or something ? __eou__
 Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long . __eou__  That sucks . __eou__
 But I still love you . __eou__  I'm sorry . __eou__
 I knew this would happen some day ... __eou__  Then why didn't you talk to me ? __eou__
 Well . It's not all my fault , Anna ... __eou__  I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but let's try to forget that and be friends . __eou__
 Have you made the decision yet ? __eou__  I think we'll be better off if we are apart . __eou__
 Then shall we keep pure friendship ? __eou__  Sure , let's just be friends . __eou__
 Not very well . __eou__  Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ? __eou__
 Nothing . __eou__  Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . __eou__
 Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane . __eou__  Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . __eou__
 Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young . __eou__  Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family . __eou__
 Maybe you're right . __eou__  Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! __eou__
 I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ? __eou__
 I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it . __eou__  That's tough . What does your wife think about this ? __eou__
 Didn't I tell you ? It's over ! __eou__  Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ? __eou__
 It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! __eou__  Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ? __eou__
 No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home ! __eou__  What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? __eou__
 I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . __eou__  I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude ! __eou__
 I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around . __eou__  I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ? __eou__
 I just broke up with a girl . Why didn't she understand that I loved her ? __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ? __eou__
 I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did . __eou__  Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call . __eou__
 I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet . __eou__  Come on , guy . Maybe she isn't your right person . __eou__
 Yes . I think I won't come here again next time . __eou__  So do I . __eou__
 We waste a vacation . __eou__  Maybe you are right . __eou__
I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking . __eou__  I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please ! __eou__
 How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more . __eou__  You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ’ d be lost without you . I won ’ t let you go anyway . __eou__
 No , I didn't . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__
 I didn't make the soccer team . __eou__  Cheer up ! It's not the end of the world . __eou__
 Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches . __eou__  Was it your first time ? __eou__
 Yeah . And I never want to go again . __eou__  I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . __eou__
Well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . Maybe we're just different kinds of people . __eou__  Yeah it's too bad ... but actually I think I know what to do . __eou__
 Yeah it's too bad ... but actually I think I know what to do . __eou__  What's that ? __eou__
 Oh , no . __eou__  Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... __eou__
 Oh , sorry . __eou__  Well , as I was saying , they showed each other what they had decided to bring . The Englishman had brought some water . " If we get thirsty , we'll have something to drink , " he said . The Scotsman brought a map . " If we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . " The Irishman had brought a car door . __eou__
 They killed another hostage . __eou__  Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . __eou__
 Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . __eou__  I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? __eou__
 I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? __eou__  Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . __eou__
Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ? __eou__  Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me . __eou__
 Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . __eou__  Uh , A ... you know I'm friends with William . __eou__
 We're sorry you have to leave . __eou__  Please excuse me , won't you ? __eou__
 I know . I wonder what's keeping him . __eou__  Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? __eou__
 Yeah , a number of times . __eou__  What's he trying to pull anyway . __eou__
 I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . __eou__  Maybe you should start seeing someone else . __eou__
 His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . __eou__  I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . __eou__
 I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . __eou__  Doesn't sound promising . __eou__
 Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . __eou__  If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . __eou__
 My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps . __eou__  Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again . __eou__
I hate landing in the sand trap ! Now I'm probably going to waste strokes getting it out . __eou__  At least you haven't landed in the water yet . I've done that on the last two holes . __eou__
I hate computer games . __eou__  Why ? They are fine . __eou__
 Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting . __eou__  Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good . __eou__
 If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad . __eou__  Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games . __eou__
 Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year . __eou__  This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ? __eou__
 This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ? __eou__  Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it . __eou__
There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow . __eou__  It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . __eou__
 It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . __eou__  Yes . We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading . __eou__
I am fed up with Jack . He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt . __eou__  So he is . But , why not try to help him to become stronger ? __eou__
 For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ? __eou__  Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic . __eou__
 You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . __eou__  Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal . __eou__
 Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ? __eou__  OK , I understand , but what else could we do ? __eou__
 But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late . __eou__  Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another . __eou__
 But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? __eou__  Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters . __eou__
 But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? __eou__  Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry . __eou__
 The internet's a lot worse . __eou__  Really ? Why ? __eou__
 There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online . __eou__  Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . __eou__
 No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept . __eou__  I tell you I must go ! __eou__
 I tell you I must go ! __eou__  Where ? __eou__
 I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion . __eou__  I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return . __eou__
 Well , my mum lost her job yesterday . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women . __eou__
 The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . __eou__  Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ? __eou__
I really like the record you lent me the other day . __eou__  I'm glad you like it . __eou__
 I'm glad you like it . __eou__  And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . __eou__
 And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Not at all . __eou__  I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it . __eou__
 I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it . __eou__  I'm glad . __eou__
 I'm glad . __eou__  Would you mind my keeping it for another week ? __eou__
 I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . __eou__  They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__
 They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__  That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__
 That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__  I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! __eou__
 I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! __eou__  Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . __eou__
 Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son . __eou__  Tell me all about it . __eou__
 Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd . __eou__  Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? __eou__
 Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . __eou__  Really ? What happened ? __eou__
 He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . __eou__  I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ? __eou__
Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . __eou__  Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . __eou__
 I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? __eou__  Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! __eou__
Congratulations on the new house ! __eou__  Thanks ! We love it . __eou__
 Thanks ! We love it . __eou__  Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful . __eou__
 Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful . __eou__  I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it ! __eou__
 Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg __eou__  Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill . __eou__
 I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . __eou__  How come you think of him that way ? __eou__
 Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . __eou__  I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . __eou__
 Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? __eou__  Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . __eou__
 I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! __eou__  Are you available on Sunday ? __eou__
 The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! __eou__  Anything else ? __eou__
 It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! __eou__  Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! __eou__
 What a pity ! You can't join us . __eou__  So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway . __eou__
 Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me . __eou__  Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? __eou__
 She said it was because we had very different ideas about life . __eou__  Do you believe her excuse ? __eou__
 Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly . __eou__  Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love . __eou__
 Everything seems to be getting worse . I don't know what to do with it . __eou__  Things are tough all over . You should never give up ! __eou__
 No , I don ’ t want to eat anything . __eou__  Why ? Don't you feel well ? __eou__
 I ’ m down in spirits . __eou__  What's up ? __eou__
 My manager jumped on me for my mistake today . __eou__  You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing . __eou__
 I think I'm too clumsy . I can do nothing well . __eou__  You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done . __eou__
 But I doubt myself . __eou__  Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life . __eou__
 I really hate this weather . __eou__  Well , it won't last long . __eou__
 Oh ! I hate rainy days ! __eou__  Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ? __eou__
 John , I am just not in the mood for this . __eou__  You look so upset . What's going on ? __eou__
 I lost the table tennis game yesterday . __eou__  Oh , what a pity ! __eou__
 I just don ’ t want to play table tennis any more . __eou__  Is it that bad ? It ’ s nothing more than a game . __eou__
 My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis . __eou__  Oh , come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ’ t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body . __eou__
I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? __eou__  Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso ! __eou__
 I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man ! __eou__  You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting . __eou__
 True ? The food is terrible . __eou__  I didn't notice . I don't really even know what I ate . __eou__
 I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . __eou__  As far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? __eou__
 Well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . __eou__  You're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . __eou__
 No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? __eou__  Come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . __eou__
 You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . __eou__  Is that your phone ? __eou__
Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! __eou__  Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? __eou__
 Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! __eou__  Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ’ t know that you had split up . What happened ? __eou__
 It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! __eou__  Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ? __eou__
 No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home ! __eou__  What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? __eou__
 I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . __eou__  I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! __eou__
 I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! __eou__  I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . __eou__
 I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . __eou__  I bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ’ t she ? __eou__
How upsetting ! He has been away for a week ! __eou__  I don't know if anything terrible has happened . __eou__
 I don't know if anything terrible has happened . __eou__  I have reported it to the police . __eou__
I hate to go outside . __eou__  Me too . __eou__
 Me too . __eou__  Why do you hate to go outside ? __eou__
 I meet too many jerks . __eou__  I agree . __eou__
 I agree . __eou__  This city is full of jerks . __eou__
 This city is full of jerks . __eou__  Rude people are everywhere . __eou__
 Rude people are everywhere . __eou__  But what can you do ? __eou__
 You can yell at them . __eou__  And they will yell back at you . __eou__
 And they will yell back at you . __eou__  Yelling doesn't do any good . __eou__
 Maybe ... but I don't think so . __eou__  Really ? What's the matter ? __eou__
 I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad . __eou__  Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . __eou__
 The water there looks so dirty . __eou__  I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica . __eou__
 But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me ! __eou__  But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . __eou__
 Frank has gone out with Lucy again . __eou__  What ’ s wrong with that ? __eou__
 Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do . __eou__  Our eyes should look into the future . We could not live in the past . __eou__
 Only sometimes when I think about it , I feel very sad . __eou__  It's normal . Time will change everything . __eou__
 I dislike it most . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 Is it a horror movie ? __eou__  Yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? __eou__
 No way . I will be scared out of my wits . __eou__  That's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . __eou__
I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it . __eou__  He is sly . He is actually angling for compliments . But he may have got the crush on you . __eou__
 Nonsense ! There's no indication that he's in love with me . __eou__  Keep your fingers crossed . He may pop the question one of these days . __eou__
 It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? __eou__  Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
They promised us a sea view . __eou__  Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . __eou__
 Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__  Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . __eou__
 With everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__  A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . __eou__
 Much better . My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me . __eou__  Don ’ t be sad . Everything will be fine . __eou__
 Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . __eou__  You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . __eou__
 I don ’ t like her husband , that bad egg , but my daughter insists on marrying him . __eou__  She is a grow-up . She can make her own decision . __eou__
I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know . __eou__  Cheer up ! Let bygones be bygones . __eou__
 I ’ Ve tried it , not a chance . __eou__  It seems you have to take time . __eou__
 That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy . __eou__  I think I must report to the cops . __eou__
 Oh dear , that sounds terrible . __eou__  It was ! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt . __eou__
 It was ! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt . __eou__  Oh dear . Well , get well soon and try to be more careful in future . __eou__
 Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . __eou__  I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . __eou__
 But I still love you . __eou__  I ’ m sorry . __eou__
 I knew this would happen some day ... __eou__  Then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? __eou__
 Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ... __eou__  I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . __eou__
 I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit . __eou__  I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . __eou__
 Shall we keep pur friendship ? __eou__  Sure , let ’ s just be friends . __eou__
 The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . __eou__  But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? __eou__
 I'll beat him . __eou__  So beat the cat , but don't kill it . __eou__
 I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! __eou__  How dare you speak to me like this . __eou__
 How dare you speak to me like this . __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 I'm sorry . __eou__  It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . __eou__
When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . __eou__  It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . __eou__
 I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . __eou__  But she means to help you , not to trouble you . __eou__
 I didn't really like it . __eou__  Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . __eou__
 I found it very disappointing . __eou__  She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . __eou__
 I wasn't happy with it . __eou__  Nothing is to your satisfaction . __eou__
I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is . __eou__  Hey , Isabelle ... __eou__
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__  Yes , I am the guy . __eou__
 What a bummer ! You set me up ? __eou__  Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... __eou__
 How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) __eou__  Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! __eou__
 Why did you lie to me in the email ? __eou__  I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . __eou__
 I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . __eou__  I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . __eou__
 I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . __eou__  Oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . __eou__
 Worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . __eou__  Office romance is very tricky . __eou__
 It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . __eou__  Cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . __eou__
 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__  How come ? __eou__
 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__  Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__
 Ur , you really let me down . __eou__  Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . __eou__
 No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . __eou__  What day is it on earth ? __eou__
 I ’ m not in the mood . __eou__  Why are you feeling depressed ? __eou__
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . __eou__  I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . __eou__
 But she did and made me disappointed . __eou__  Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__
 But she means a lot to me . __eou__  Then forgive her mistake . __eou__
 How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . __eou__  It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . __eou__
 It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . __eou__  I have been looking forward to this performance all month . __eou__
 I have been looking forward to this performance all month . __eou__  I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . __eou__
All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull . __eou__  Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls . __eou__
 I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . __eou__  Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . __eou__
 I can't think the same . __eou__  What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__  Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__
 But you should have told me you were in love with her . __eou__  Didn't I ? __eou__
 You know you didn't . __eou__  Well , I'm telling you now . __eou__
 Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__  I didn't think you'd be interested . __eou__
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? __eou__  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__  I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__
 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__  Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__
 Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__  I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__
 I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__  You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
 It's scary . __eou__  Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . __eou__
Why don't you watch where you're going ? __eou__  Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! __eou__
 There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . __eou__  Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . __eou__
 It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . __eou__  Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . __eou__
 Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . __eou__  Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . __eou__
 It really hurts . __eou__  Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? __eou__
 To hell with you . The accident was your fault . __eou__  I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? __eou__
 Oh , don't talk to me about yesterday ! It was the most awful evening I've ever had . __eou__  Why ! what happened ? __eou__
 Well.John had promised to be my date , but he stood me up . I waited for a full hour in the cold wind . __eou__  So how long did you stay ? __eou__
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! __eou__  Oh , my dear lady.Take it easy.You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__  I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__
 I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__  Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss . __eou__
Our son is gone and my heart is gone too . I don ’ t know how to spend the rest of my years . __eou__  Oh , darling , we must stand shoulder to shoulder and face the music . I know you can pull yourself together . __eou__
 I feel life is meaningless without him . __eou__  Cheer up . You have got me at least . __eou__
 I didn't really like it . __eou__  Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . __eou__
 I found it very disappointing . __eou__  She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . __eou__
 I wasn't happy with it . __eou__  Nothing is to your satisfaction . __eou__
 Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . __eou__  What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . __eou__
 Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . __eou__  What am I going to do ? __eou__
 I ’ m not crazy about it at all . __eou__  You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? __eou__
 I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? __eou__  Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . __eou__
 I hate it . __eou__  Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__  Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__
 But you should have told me you were in love with her . __eou__  Didn't I ? __eou__
 You know you didn't . __eou__  Well , I'm telling you now . __eou__
 Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__  I didn't think you'd be interested . __eou__
 You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? __eou__  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__
 My father failed in business . __eou__  Oh , that's really tough . __eou__
 Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . __eou__  I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? __eou__
 No , not now . I have found a part-time job.So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . __eou__  Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . __eou__
 Not really . I thought it was disappointing . __eou__  It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? __eou__
 It must be a haunted house.Are you frightened ? __eou__  Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
 I failed my oral test . __eou__  How come ? __eou__
 I dislike it most . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ? __eou__  I'm sorry , It's all my fault . __eou__
 You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her . __eou__  Sorry , I had no intention . __eou__
 It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ? __eou__  I know I was an idiot , But if there is anything I can do to make up , Please do tell me . __eou__
 It's us . __eou__  What do you mean by us ? __eou__
 Well , you always say you're busy . __eou__  That's right . __eou__
 Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__  Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__
 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__  How come ? __eou__
 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__  Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__
 I dislike it most . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat . __eou__  Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you . __eou__
 He asked me to beef up in the work . __eou__  Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . __eou__
 I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend . __eou__  Oh , cheer up . A boyfriend is not everything . __eou__
 Ur , you really let me down . __eou__  Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . __eou__
 No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . __eou__  What day is it on earth ? __eou__
 Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . __eou__  I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__
 I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P . m . __eou__  Ok . See you tomorrow . __eou__
 Not really . I thought it was disappointing . __eou__  It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? __eou__
 I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later . __eou__  Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping ! __eou__
 And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! __eou__  Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! __eou__
 Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! __eou__  Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__
 Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__  Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__
 Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__  Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__
 Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__  I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! __eou__
 Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying . __eou__  Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia . __eou__
 I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! __eou__  He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__
 He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__  Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . __eou__
 That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! __eou__  So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? __eou__
 Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . __eou__  Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . __eou__
 Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . __eou__  I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . __eou__
 I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . __eou__  Laura ... __eou__
 Laura ... __eou__  Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye . __eou__
 Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__  I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__
 This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! __eou__  Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . __eou__
 I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . __eou__  Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? __eou__
 I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . __eou__  What about sunday ? __eou__
 Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . __eou__  I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . __eou__
Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . __eou__  Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . __eou__
Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . __eou__  But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? __eou__
 I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! __eou__  I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . __eou__
I'm afraid I can't go to the pictures with you tomorrow . __eou__  Busy with your work again ? __eou__
 Of course not . I'm afraid of them . __eou__  I mean , do you like snake meat ? __eou__
 Oh , I'm afraid I'll be busy tomorrow evening . __eou__  Some other time then ? __eou__
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . __eou__  That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . __eou__
 Sorry to hear that . __eou__  How about next week ? __eou__
 That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . __eou__  What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? __eou__
Many people say it's a good story.But I think it's boring ! __eou__  I don't think I share your view there.The writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on.It ' s too hard to understand . __eou__
 Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week . __eou__  No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness . __eou__
 Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . __eou__  That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . __eou__
 That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . __eou__  What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? __eou__
 You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! __eou__  Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? __eou__
I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . __eou__  You shouldn't be so negative.You ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.But if you are negative and start name-calling in the office , it will make a bad working environment for everybody . __eou__
 You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . __eou__  Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp . __eou__
So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything . __eou__  Um ... Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO . Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot . He actually is the CEO now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with . __eou__
 Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill ! __eou__  No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company . __eou__
 What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? __eou__  He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company . __eou__
Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . __eou__  John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . __eou__
 I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . __eou__  Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? __eou__
 I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . __eou__  Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . __eou__
 If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . __eou__  Yup , that ’ s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . __eou__
 Yup , that ’ s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . __eou__  I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire . __eou__
 I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire . __eou__  That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . __eou__
 That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . __eou__  I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . __eou__
I'm really tired of my job in the bank . I'm thinking about changing it . __eou__  Have you any definite idea ? __eou__
 Oh , it's really a drag . __eou__  Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond . __eou__
I've had enough of that ! __eou__  Why , this is the most interesting film ! __eou__
 I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . __eou__  But it's only a film . __eou__
 It was a nightmare . __eou__  What ’ s up ? __eou__
The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! __eou__  I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy ! __eou__
 Oh , great . That's just my luck ! I hate those arty movies . __eou__  Well , too bad . So , what foreign film won an Oscar in 1993 ? __eou__
 Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . __eou__  That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . __eou__
 That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . __eou__  What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? __eou__
 What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? __eou__  It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? __eou__
 Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . __eou__  But if the company asks , what else can we do ? __eou__
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? __eou__  Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . __eou__
 It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . __eou__  You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . __eou__
 Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! __eou__  It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . __eou__
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__  yes , I am the guy ... __eou__
 what a bummer ! You set me up ? __eou__  let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... __eou__
 Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . __eou__  I won't . __eou__
 Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . __eou__  Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? __eou__
I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . __eou__  What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? __eou__
 He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . __eou__  Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... __eou__
 You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . __eou__  That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him . __eou__
 I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . __eou__  Why don't you take a few days off ? __eou__
 I just lost my job . My boss just told me . __eou__  That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? __eou__
 Well , I had a terrible day of work , I'm thinking of quiting my job . __eou__  Take it easy , maybe tomorrow will be different . __eou__
 I don't know , I can't stand my job these days . __eou__  Cheer up , I hope you'll feel better soon . __eou__
I am having a hard time at my job . __eou__  What's wrong , Julia ? __eou__
 My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore . __eou__  Don't give up so soon . __eou__
 But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy . __eou__  Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from . __eou__
I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . __eou__  Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please . I make a solemn promise never to drink alcohol again . __eou__
 How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you ! __eou__  Have a heart , honey . You know I am trying hard to quit drinking , don't you ? Just give me one more chance , please ! __eou__
 That's true . Her husband is a fat cat . __eou__  But I don't think she really loves him . __eou__
 She is only after his money . __eou__  If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love . __eou__
 Well . I am breaking up with Cathy . __eou__  What happened ? Did you have a fight ? __eou__
 Maybe tonight . I don't know . I don't know how to tell her . __eou__  I know she ’ s head over heels in love with you . She will be badly hurt ! __eou__
 What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . __eou__  Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . __eou__
 But she lied to me . __eou__  Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ? __eou__
 Company ? I heard about you from Linda . She said you were an octopus ! __eou__  What can I say ? I am a passionate guy . __eou__
 Well , I hope you can find something else to be passionate about . __eou__  You want to go out with me and you know it . __eou__
 In your dreams . Now if you don't mind , I've got some work to do . __eou__  Ok , I get the message . Hey , do you have any sisters ? __eou__
 My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . __eou__  Did you finish typing yesterday ? __eou__
 Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . __eou__  Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? __eou__
 Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . __eou__  How about the shelf ? __eou__
 I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? __eou__  Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . __eou__
 I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? __eou__  Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? __eou__
 I didn't sleep a wink last night . __eou__  Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you . __eou__
 Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects . __eou__  Is there anything I can do to help you ? __eou__
 Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it . __eou__  Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . __eou__
Lousy weather , isn't it ? __eou__  It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . __eou__
 It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery . __eou__  The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports . __eou__
 Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings . __eou__  But what would other people think ? __eou__
 Well I don ’ t think so . I don ’ t like it at all ! __eou__  I ’ m afraid you ’ re being too particular about your food . __eou__
 We ’ re in the same boat ! I ’ Ve eaten fast food the whole week . I hate it now . __eou__  Poor us ! All this junk food lacks nutrition ! __eou__
 What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job . __eou__  Then , buy a bottle of soft drink . __eou__
 Sorry , Mr . Polly . __eou__  It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ? __eou__
 It sounds too bad . What will you do ? __eou__  Mike suggests me to return it . __eou__
 Not great . It's a kind of boring . __eou__  Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great . __eou__
 What a pity ! I know you've been longing for it these months . __eou__  The only thing I can do now is waiting for another chance . __eou__
 You think it's funny . I'm terrified . __eou__  Don't worry . It's safe . __eou__
 But I've never jumped off anything in my life . The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed . I'm scared . __eou__  You are the one who wanted to come here , Sandy . You should enjoy it . __eou__
 I guess I'm adventuresome , but then I'm scared too . __eou__  I'm not too scared . But I've done sky diving before . __eou__
 What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . __eou__  Not for me , Dick . __eou__
 Oh , no ! What happened ? __eou__  Hilda Harris husband , Henry had an accident on his way home from work . __eou__
 How awful ! Was he hurt ? __eou__  Yes . He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance . __eou__
 How horrible ! __eou__  He ’ s having an operation in the hospital now . Poor Hilda ! You can imagine how unhappy she is . __eou__
 Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . __eou__  Luckily that was nothing serious . __eou__
I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing . __eou__  Don ’ t worry . Everyone knows you ’ re getting your feet wet . I ’ ll show you how . I bet you ’ ll be proficient at this in five minutes . __eou__
 No ! ! ! __eou__  There . Now , wasn ’ t that fun ? As soon as you get a second burst of energy , we ’ ll ... __eou__
 I ’ d love to , but you know I ’ Ve got another appointment . I ’ m really sorry . __eou__  I see . Then what about tomorrow , at Starbucks ? __eou__
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m already booked up for next Sunday . But thank you just the same . __eou__  That ’ s a pity . We can arrange another time hopefully . __eou__
He ’ s got laid off again . I do feel sorry for him . __eou__  Do you really ? __eou__
 I had a bad day yesterday . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 I went to the library and lost my bag . __eou__  Your bag ? Did you get it back ? __eou__
I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent . __eou__  I'll try to speak more clearly . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here . __eou__  Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it . __eou__
 Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . __eou__  What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? __eou__
 Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! __eou__  Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . __eou__
 I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! __eou__  He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__
 He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__  Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . __eou__
 Skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 Sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night . __eou__  Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us . __eou__
 Sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going . __eou__  Yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move . __eou__
 unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . __eou__  what happened to him then ? __eou__
 No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin __eou__  Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea __eou__
 I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . __eou__  I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves __eou__
 I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! __eou__  I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds . __eou__
 That's too bad.They ' re such good company . __eou__  I think there's someone at the door . Excuse me while I go and get that . __eou__
 Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! __eou__  Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? __eou__
 Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? __eou__  It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise ! __eou__
 I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! __eou__  That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! __eou__
 All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__  Whatever , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . __eou__
Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! __eou__  I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! __eou__
 I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! __eou__  Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . __eou__
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? __eou__  Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . __eou__
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! __eou__  I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__
 I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__  I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? __eou__
 Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__  It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__
 I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ? __eou__  I am worried about the meeting this morning . __eou__
Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! __eou__  Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? __eou__
 I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! __eou__  What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! __eou__
 I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . __eou__  Come on.We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . __eou__
 I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . __eou__  Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . __eou__
 I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . __eou__  OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! __eou__
 You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? __eou__  But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . __eou__
 He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up . __eou__  Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright . __eou__
 But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up ! __eou__  You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ... __eou__
 No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ... __eou__  do you hear something ? __eou__
 Hey , watch where you ’ re going ! __eou__  Oh , no ! I ’ m so sorry ! Are you all right ? __eou__
 Awful . It was a complete waste of time . __eou__  Why ? What was it about ? __eou__
 I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . __eou__  come on , nothing can be that bad . __eou__
 I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . __eou__  oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . __eou__
 worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . __eou__  office romance is very tricky . __eou__
 it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . __eou__  cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . __eou__
 to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break ! __eou__  are you doing anything this weekend ? __eou__
 I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! __eou__  are you available on Sunday ? __eou__
 but I still love you . __eou__  I ’ m sorry . __eou__
 I knew this would happen some day ... __eou__  then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? __eou__
 to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__  what's wrong ? __eou__
 well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . __eou__  that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it . __eou__
 the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . __eou__  I see how that can get a bit annoying . __eou__
 a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar . __eou__  so what are you going to do about it ? __eou__
 Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall . __eou__  How so ? __eou__
 He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help . __eou__  Have you talk to him about it ? __eou__
 Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night __eou__  Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight . __eou__
 No , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter . __eou__  True , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ? __eou__
 My brother in-law just dropped in from the states . __eou__  Yeah , and ? __eou__
 I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . __eou__  I guess you think twice next time he comes . __eou__
 I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . __eou__  as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? __eou__
 well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . __eou__  you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . __eou__
 to be honest , I was just dumped . __eou__  oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up . __eou__
 no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling . __eou__  come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ? __eou__
 you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! __eou__  I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love ! __eou__
 really ? Who do you chat with ? __eou__  to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were __eou__
 no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t __eou__  well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost b __eou__
 yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . __eou__  oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . __eou__
 what a bummer ! You set me up ? __eou__  let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... __eou__
 how dare you ! __eou__  hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! __eou__
 It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts . __eou__  I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ? __eou__
 She made another white crack about my clothes . __eou__  Are you sure she was trying to put you down ? __eou__
 addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! __eou__  yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ? __eou__
 Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! __eou__  You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? __eou__
 Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . __eou__  What sort of clothes does he wear ? __eou__
 Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ? __eou__  I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all ! __eou__
 Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing ! __eou__  Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company . __eou__
 What a nuisance ! __eou__  Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day . __eou__
Could you please stop flipping the channels ? __eou__  I ’ m very sorry . __eou__
May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere . __eou__  It ’ s not my fault . Daniel always sends things flying . __eou__
Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more . __eou__  I dare you to say that again . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I feel nothing is going smooth . __eou__  Take it easy . It ’ s no good worrying . You were on your last leg if you keep worrying in this way . __eou__
My God ! Why did you bring me here ? I hate the taste of coffee . __eou__  Really ? I have a weakness for coffee . __eou__
I have lots of work to do . What ’ s more , my grandma is ill . __eou__  I am sorry to hear that , but face the music . __eou__
I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday . __eou__  Dear , let ’ s drop the subject . __eou__
I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now ! __eou__  I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself . __eou__
Honey , please forgive me . There is lots of work to do . So , I forget your birthday . __eou__  I see.That ’ s all right . Don ’ t put the blame on yourself . __eou__
Why aren ’ t they are aware of the gravity of the situation ? __eou__  Because they are rednecks . __eou__
I am sorry . I didn ’ t accomplish the job on time . __eou__  That ’ s all right . Everyone feels under the weather sometimes . Just finish the rest when you feel well . __eou__
I am sorry to make you run down to the office for me . __eou__  No trouble . I enjoyed helping you . __eou__
Sorry . The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired . __eou__  Knock on wood . But I have a very important date . __eou__
Oh , my god . What happened ? Are we dying ? __eou__  Don ’ t sweat it . We will land safely . __eou__
After this lunch , I haven ’ t got much green left . __eou__  Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out . __eou__

 on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . __eou__  as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . __eou__
We are through . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . __eou__  I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her . __eou__

 Thank you for your help . __eou__  No problem . Good luck . __eou__
 It's pretty . Can I try it on ? __eou__  You can try it on in the fitting room over there . __eou__
 Great , so we can afford the new apartment after all ! __eou__  Uh huh ... but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on . __eou__
Come on , fellows . Let's enjoy my wife's cooking ! __eou__  Em , it's delicious ! __eou__
 Em , it's delicious ! __eou__  Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . __eou__
 Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . __eou__  You're lucky . __eou__
 Thank you . Anything else ? __eou__  No , thanks . __eou__
 Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ? __eou__  Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here . __eou__
 Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section . __eou__  This one is good . __eou__
 This one is good . __eou__  You have good taste . It is very much in style this year . __eou__
 You have good taste . It is very much in style this year . __eou__  I'll take this one . How much are they ? __eou__
 What an excellent idea ! __eou__  Shall we do some jogging ? __eou__
 I feel well now . __eou__  Yes , some exercise is necessary for us . __eou__
 Excellent . How many would you like ? __eou__  Two thousand would be fine . __eou__
 Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . __eou__  Do you think you could finish it in three days ? __eou__
 Thank you . Bye-bye ! __eou__  You're welcome , bye ! __eou__
 Thanks . Nothing else , today ? __eou__  Nothing else , thank you . __eou__
 It suits my taste . You are really a good cook . __eou__  Would you like to try my special recipe ? __eou__
 It's pretty . How much is it ? __eou__  Fifty yuan . __eou__
 Great . I'll take one . __eou__  Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 200 yuan in any loreal products , you will receive this black hand bag with a sample of blusher , mascara and two shades of eye shadow . __eou__
 Wow . That sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and powder . Could you ring those up for me along with the lipstick ? __eou__  I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ? __eou__
 It sounds wonderful . Do I have to sign a lease ? How much should I pay ? __eou__  Yes , it ’ s a one-year lease . And $ 200 a week with one month refundable deposit . __eou__
 OK . Good-bye . __eou__  Good-bye . __eou__
Oh honey , I tell you good news . The apartment I looked at today was pretty decent , around 120 square meters . __eou__  Great . What about the surrounding area ? __eou__
 Very quiet and safe . And it ’ s got a lot of trees and plants . __eou__  That ’ s good . Is the location easily accessible ? __eou__
 That ’ s good . Is the location easily accessible ? __eou__  Yep , it ’ s near a bus stop . __eou__
 Here you are . Thank you , bye-bye ! __eou__  Bye-bye . Welcome to come next time ! __eou__
 Sound great . Let's go ! __eou__  Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  Would you mail this letter for me when you go to the post office ? __eou__
 I think it's beautiful . I want to hang it in the living room . __eou__  It looks like some kind of mistake . __eou__
 Really ? You've done a good job . __eou__  Thank you . May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows ? __eou__
 Thank you . May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows ? __eou__  I have never heard that men would trim their eyebrows . Are you kidding ? __eou__
 I have never heard that men would trim their eyebrows . Are you kidding ? __eou__  No , sir , I am serious . Haven't you heard that today men are becoming increasingly interested in having their eyebrows professionally groomed ? __eou__
 I'm glad I asked you . So this is aisle 6 where I can find all the canned fruits and vegetables . __eou__  That ’ s correct . __eou__
I'm glad these batteries are on sale . __eou__  I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale . __eou__
 That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye ! __eou__  My pleasure , bye ! __eou__
 Thank you , but I'm just looking around . How much does this skirt cost ? __eou__  This is the new style.Two hundred and twenty-eight . __eou__
 Pure gold ones , please . This is so beautiful . I'll take it . __eou__  OK . __eou__
 Sure . Please come this way . __eou__  May I try it on ? __eou__
 Of course . Here is the fitting room . __eou__  It doesn't fit quite right . It feels a little tight in the waist . Do you have this in a larger size ? __eou__
 You look really beautiful in it . __eou__  OK . I'll take it . __eou__
 What ? But today is my birthday ! __eou__  I know , darling . But I do have a lot of work to do , hope you can understand me . __eou__
 By all means . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 OK . Thank you . Bye-bye . __eou__  Bye . __eou__
 No . Thank you . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
 Really ? OK ! __eou__  This way please . First , we should clean your face with our clarifying cream . And then we use the massage cream . Next do the massage . I hope that you can feel comfortable . __eou__
 Very comfortable . I think I will come next time . Maybe I will take some friends . Amazing ! __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 That's a good idea . But leave the front as it is now . __eou__  ( several minutes later ) Now it's done . Is it satisfactory ? __eou__
 Very good , thanks . __eou__  Anything else I can do for you , sir ? __eou__
 Out ? What do you mean out ? __eou__  You know , on a date . They're going to dinner . __eou__
 Thank you . It looks very attractive . __eou__  I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot . __eou__
 Tasty and tender ! It must be one of the famous local dishes . __eou__  Yes . It's a traditional dish . __eou__
 Good . I prefer beef soup . __eou__  According to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . If you like we'll bring you some soup first . __eou__
 With pleasure . __eou__  Oh , it is not easy to learn ! __eou__
 No , that's all . Thanks . __eou__  One hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow . __eou__
 OK . We look forward to seeing you . Goodbye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
 Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . __eou__  Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . __eou__
 Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? __eou__  Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right . __eou__
 Very good , sir . A table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . May I have your name , please ? __eou__  It's John . __eou__
 Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time . __eou__  Yeah , but I wish they delivered video games too . Then I would never leave my house ! __eou__
Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ? __eou__  I am cooking now ! __eou__
 Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . __eou__  Thank you for your praise . __eou__
 Thank you for your praise . __eou__  Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  It's my pleasure . __eou__
 No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated . __eou__  I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own . __eou__
 That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . __eou__  Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? __eou__
 Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? __eou__  Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? __eou__
 That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? __eou__  The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it . __eou__
 Yes , thanks . __eou__  It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . __eou__
 It's very good . How do you make it ? __eou__  I use a special dressing and homemade catsup . __eou__
 This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day . __eou__  I'm glad you like it . __eou__
 I'm glad you like it . __eou__  You Americans usually have nutritious food . __eou__
 Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ? __eou__  We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  Do you need a hand with that ? __eou__
 Actually , I could use some help . Thank you so much . __eou__  Don't worry about it . __eou__
 Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . __eou__  I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . __eou__
 OK . Thanks . __eou__  Bye bye . __eou__
 Yes . It's superb . __eou__  Well , it's kind of you to say so . __eou__
 That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ? __eou__  The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ? __eou__
 OK . I will be free at tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there . __eou__  All right , see you . __eou__
 That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ? __eou__  It says it's located in the suburbs . __eou__
 Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ? __eou__  Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you . __eou__
 Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ? __eou__  It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month . __eou__
 That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well . __eou__  That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there . __eou__
 That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office . __eou__  No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . __eou__
 I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost . __eou__  Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there . __eou__
 Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ? __eou__  Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place . __eou__
 Here are all kinds of jades . Choose whatever you like , please . __eou__  Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ? __eou__
 Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ? __eou__  Yes . Natural pearls or cultured pearls ? We have both kinds . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  It's just a formality , but for hire purchase we usually require references . __eou__
 Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . __eou__  Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . __eou__
 Sure , why not ? __eou__  This is a new product of company this year . It's oil-free . __eou__
 I see . It feels very light on the skin . __eou__  It gives your skin a very natural healthy look . __eou__
 That's good . Thank you . __eou__  Here we are . I hope you will like it . __eou__
 It's good . It's a nice room . __eou__  And here is the menu . I'll come back soon . __eou__
 Of course and very well . __eou__  What's the English for Hongtao , Leitao , Meihua and Fangpian ? __eou__
 Sure , here you go . __eou__  Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . __eou__
 Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . __eou__  Of course . There you are . __eou__
 Of course . There you are . __eou__  Thanks so much . I owe you one . __eou__
 Very nice . I am sure we will sort out your Internet in no time . __eou__  I am on my way to the doctor now , but I should be back in about 45 minutes . Can I come back at around 3:15 ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Very good . Could I serve you anything else ? __eou__  Thank you . That's enough . __eou__
 Thank you . That's enough . __eou__  My pleasure . Just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch . __eou__
 My pleasure . Just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim . __eou__  If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here . __eou__

 Oh , this is just fine . __eou__  Please take a seat . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Here is the menu . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ? __eou__  Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ? __eou__
 Oh . that's very nice of him . __eou__  Yeah , it was . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you . __eou__

 It sounds good . __eou__  Yes , it is the best of our hotel . __eou__
 Really ? Let me have a try . __eou__  Thank you . Just a moment , please . __eou__
 You must be kidding ! You cannot get that price anywhere . __eou__  I am serious . $ 15,000 . __eou__
 OK . Wait for a moment , please . I'll be back in a moment with the dishes . __eou__  OK . Thank you . __eou__
 No , thanks . __eou__  Thank you , sir . Just a moment , please . __eou__
 It sounds good . I'll try it . __eou__  Would you like to have a drink ? __eou__
 Do you have hypertension ? I would have thought you were too young . __eou__  Actually , my blood pressure isn't that high yet , but they say it increases with age . __eou__
 Well , I'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet . __eou__  I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too . __eou__
Bob , look at this sentence . ' Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . ' It's interesting , isn't it ? __eou__  I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those ' strict nutrition philosophies ' about ? __eou__
 Seriously ? __eou__  Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so . __eou__
 Thank you . Your cash back is $ 13 . Pull into a parking space . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Thank you for telling me so much , I'll try them next time . __eou__  I'm always at your service . __eou__

 These are beautiful ! Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ? __eou__  Yes , sir . __eou__
 How fine the needlework is ! What's the price ? __eou__  Ninety dollars . __eou__
 You are not going to believe this . Do you remember the dress we saw at Mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? I got it today at half price . __eou__  So they have started the year end sale earlier this year . __eou__
 How can you stay so calm ? Aren't you going to take a look to see if there is anything for you ? __eou__  I guess I'll wait a few more days . There maybe even bigger discount then . __eou__
Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me . __eou__  Yes , this is a very popular car . __eou__
 May I have a look at that china tea set ? It is extremely beautiful . __eou__  You've made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . It was made in Jingdezhen . __eou__

 That was quick work . Let me have a look at it . Yeah , everything looks fine now . Thank you very much . __eou__  You are welcome , doctor . __eou__
 I am glad you like it . __eou__  Can we have the bill now ? __eou__
 It's a good idea . __eou__  I want a Hamburger and ice cream . What about you ? __eou__
 Sure . Wait a moment . __eou__  By the way , I would like some chilli oil . __eou__
That dog has white long hair . It ’ s lovely . __eou__  She is my dog . I like her very much . __eou__
 I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year . __eou__  That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show . __eou__
 Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ? __eou__  No . You know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing . __eou__

 Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . __eou__  You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . __eou__
 Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east . __eou__  No , east is the other direction . To get to the Bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway . When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm , you hang a left . Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Sorry , but she's out . __eou__

 It's pretty . May I try it on ? __eou__  Sure . The fitting room is over there . __eou__
 These shoes are great ! What is the price of this ? __eou__  This one is two hundred yuan . __eou__
 Thank you . I never can find my way around this store . __eou__  I know . It took me three weeks , and I work here . __eou__
 Really ? Too expensive . I don't think I can afford it . __eou__  But it is really worthwhile . __eou__
 Oh , they look just like live cranes . __eou__  And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity . __eou__
 Really ? How much is it ? Oh , it's 42 yuan ! How expensive ! __eou__  You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year . __eou__
 Oh , my God ! __eou__  I suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Oh dear ! That's terrible ! What was in your wallet ? __eou__  Well , some money . of course , my visa , all my identity cards and some photos . __eou__
 Welcome to come again . __eou__  OK . __eou__
 This is the very thing I've been dreaming of . __eou__  It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China . __eou__
 It must be most precious . __eou__  But it is really worth the price . __eou__
 No , I'm strictly a spectator . I just like watching skating . It's so beautiful . __eou__  Then you must know a lot about skating . __eou__
 Oh , thank you very much . __eou__  You're welcome . By the way , is there a pay phone near here ? __eou__
 Of course . __eou__  Are they genuine ? __eou__
 Good . You scared me . __eou__  Sorry . Can you please help me up ! I have trouble standing up by myself with the skis on . __eou__
 What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? __eou__  Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks . __eou__
Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot . It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness . __eou__  You can have a bird view of Chilin City from the top of the mountain . __eou__
 Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing . __eou__  You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the coming . __eou__
 No wonder people say , Even the immortals would rather be Guiliners . __eou__  ... Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky . __eou__
 ... Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky . __eou__  I didn't know you liked bird watching . __eou__
 Wow ! That's expensive . __eou__  What you're paying for , Ma'am , are the ingredients . It is a very high quality product . __eou__
 Not bad . Actually , it makes me look younger . I like it . __eou__  Try the lipstick as well . See , how fresh and charming you look . __eou__
Hey ! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones ! It's loaded with extras . __eou__  What does it do ? __eou__
 It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to . It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone ! __eou__  Wow ! What else does it do ? __eou__
 Wow ! What else does it do ? __eou__  I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . I can even surf the net . __eou__
 I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . I can even surf the net . __eou__  Cool ! Anything else ? __eou__
 Cool ! Anything else ? __eou__  Yes . With the 60 - second digital memory , I can record my voice and send it using voice message mode . __eou__
 Wow ! __eou__  You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone . __eou__
 You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone . __eou__  Man , that's amazing . It must have cost a bundle . __eou__
 Man , that's amazing . It must have cost a bundle . __eou__  Nah ! It was cheap ! __eou__
 Thank you . Have a nice day . __eou__  Thanks and you too . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for ! __eou__  You have good taste . It's made of red wood . __eou__
 I hope you will ! Take your time . We have a lot more upstairs . __eou__  Oh , you do ? You certainly have a large selection . __eou__
 I see . Thanks a lot . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Good . How much is a one-way ticket ? __eou__  It's 38 dollars . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Don't mention it . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 I just went to bed ! __eou__  You shouldn't have stayed up so late watching TV . I told you we had to get an early start . __eou__
 Good.Can I walk through this building ? __eou__  I'm afraid you can't . You'll have to go out there and walk around . __eou__
 I appreciate it . Thank you . __eou__  That's all right . __eou__
 Here is my name card . Thanks . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 That's absurd . __eou__  I know some junior high kids who can stay out later than that . __eou__
 All right . Thank you very much . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 I will call again in twenty minutes . Thanks . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Good idea . Let's go . Where should we go ? __eou__  Let's go to Julian Store . __eou__
 Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me . __eou__  Please show me your receipt again . __eou__
Wow ! What's the hold up ? __eou__  It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now . __eou__
 Sure . Take your time . __eou__  How much does the green one cost ? __eou__
This looks like a nice restaurant . __eou__  Yeah , it is . I come here all the time . __eou__

 Here you are . You look younger in yellow . __eou__  I think so too . How much is it ? __eou__
Look ! Allen has the mic ! __eou__  I thought he only liked to listen ! __eou__
 That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it any more , so he decided to give it a try himself ! __eou__  ( Sound of Allen singing ) Hey , Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Johnny Dean ! __eou__
 ( Sound of Allen singing ) Hey , Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Johnny Dean ! __eou__  And he can move . too ! He dances like Ricky Martin ! __eou__
Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! __eou__  lt's a TV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . __eou__

 Where is Tom ? It was his idea to have the bachelor party at a ETV , wasn't it ? __eou__  If it were up to Tom , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ? He loves to sing . __eou__

 Very good , need I help you ? __eou__  No , don't need , I can do myself . __eou__
 Thanks . I can watch TV now . __eou__  But you must cook that dinner next time . __eou__
 No , I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway . __eou__  Ok . __eou__
 Oh , no . That ’ s it . Nice to chat with you . Have a good day . __eou__  Thanks a lot . We arrived at Kaohsiung International Airport . __eou__
 Sure , let's take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  I can tell you worked hard on it . __eou__
 I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago . __eou__  Well , it was definitely worth all the time . __eou__
It's very nice of you to invite me . __eou__  I'm very glad you could come , Mr . Liu . Will you take a seat at the head of the table ? It's an informal dinner , please don't stand on ceremony ... Mr . Liu , would you like to have some chicken ? __eou__
 I'm very glad you could come , Mr . Liu . Will you take a seat at the head of the table ? It's an informal dinner , please don't stand on ceremony ... Mr . Liu , would you like to have some chicken ? __eou__  Thank you . This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant . Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food ? __eou__
 Thank you . This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant . Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food ? __eou__  Generally speaking , Cantonese food is a bit light ; Shanghai food is rather oily ; and Hunan dishes are very spicy , having a strong and hot taste . __eou__
 No more , thank you . I'm quite full . __eou__  Did you enjoy the meal ? __eou__
 It's the most delicious dinner I've had for a long time . It's such a rich dinner . __eou__  I'm so glad you like it . __eou__
 I'm so glad you like it . __eou__  Thank you very much for your hospitality . __eou__

 That's fine . __eou__  Come here and I will measure you . __eou__
 Thank you . How much is this kind of chocolate ? __eou__  $ 10 a kilo . __eou__
 You're kidding . We'll never make it across in one piece ! Let's cross at the light . __eou__  Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street . __eou__
 Great , thanks . __eou__  No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers ! __eou__
 No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers ! __eou__  Oh , I see . __eou__
 Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two . __eou__  Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . __eou__
 Yeah ! I bought it the day it was released . __eou__  How do you like it ? __eou__
 Mechwarrior is such a good game . The graphics are awesome ! __eou__  Oh , I know what you mean . I'm addicted to that game . __eou__
 Oh , I know what you mean . I'm addicted to that game . __eou__  My roommate always wants to play it . But I told her to buy her own game . __eou__
 I've never seen such good graphics . __eou__  And I've never heard such good sound in a game . __eou__
All the food smells tasty today and makes my mouth water . __eou__  Let's line up here . This line seems a little shorter . __eou__
 That's good , we can share what we have . Here we are . You go ahead . __eou__  ( They get everything ready ) Here is a free table . Let's sit down . Help yourself to some fish please . Isn't it delicious and appetizing ? __eou__
 Thank you . I'm through with one steamed bread and I'd like a second helping . __eou__  Your appetite is good . __eou__
 Your appetite is good . __eou__  I'm always feeling hungry . __eou__
 Great . I have long been looking forward to there . __eou__  Me , too . There are so many cheap but nice things . __eou__
 That's really cheap . I will take it . __eou__  Sure . Here you are . __eou__
 Yes , I know and I like it very much . I will take it . __eou__  Sure . Here is your receipt . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Excuse me , waiter , could you bring me some barbecue sauce ? __eou__
 Excellent choice . ( He brings her the pie . After she finishes , the waiter comes back . ) Would you like anything else ? __eou__  No , I'm stuffed . I'm ready for the check . __eou__
 Here you are . Thank you and have a nice evening . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Great . They've all got built-in TVs . __eou__  Cool ! We can watch Ally Mcneal ! __eou__
 Cool ! We can watch Ally Mcneal ! __eou__  But we could just stay there for 20 minutes . __eou__
 I'll go take a look . Thanks for your help . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Oh , I see it . Thanks for your help . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 Thank you . I think I'll take this one , and these pants as well . They're presents for a friend . __eou__  Shall I gift-wrap them for you , sir ? __eou__
 That's a good idea . Let's bring our trunks and towels . __eou__  Would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ? __eou__
 Looks good . __eou__  Would you like a shave ? __eou__
 Okay , let me brush you off . Thank you very much for coming . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? __eou__  My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . __eou__
This place is great . I'm surprised there are so many things here . __eou__  Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store . __eou__
 Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . __eou__  Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . __eou__
 Thank you . I try to keep in shape . __eou__  Do you often exercise ? __eou__
 Good . I'll get three pounds of it . __eou__  Here it is . Four pounds and fifty pence in all . __eou__
 Sounds good . __eou__  That'll be $ 70 , please . Will you be paying by cash or charge ? __eou__
 Okay , sir , here you are . Thank you very much . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Welcome to my shop next time . __eou__
 Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them . __eou__  May I have a look at your passport , please ? __eou__
 You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . __eou__  What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? __eou__
 Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport __eou__  Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . __eou__
 Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . __eou__  I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? __eou__
 Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . __eou__  Did I do it right ? __eou__
 Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? __eou__  Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . __eou__
 An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . __eou__  Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? __eou__
 Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ? __eou__  Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . __eou__
 Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ? __eou__  Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number . __eou__
 Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number . __eou__  OK . Can you tell me the delivery time ? __eou__
 Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ? __eou__  You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Anytime . __eou__
 Thanks for your understanding . __eou__  You're welcome . Happy couples need mutual understanding . __eou__
 Wow ! It ’ s really good for me , especially the living room . It is big enough to put all my stuff there . It ’ s a deal ! I ’ ll rent this one . __eou__  Okay . Now we need you to fill a form with your personal information . We need information like social insurance number ( Social security number in the US ) , your address , phone number , etc . We also need a security deposit of $ 200 . And you have to pay two months ’ rent in advance for renting the first time . If there ’ s nothing damaged , we ’ ll give you back one month ’ s rent when you move out . You ’ ll be responsible for all the utilities . Do you want to sign a lease today ? __eou__
 Sure ! __eou__  Oh , one more thing I forgot . You must let us know two months in advance if you want to stop renting within the contract . Otherwise , you can ’ t get your deposit back . __eou__
 Okay . Thank you for your reminder . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . Be sure to get the keys one day before you move in . __eou__

 Don't mention it . It is my duty . __eou__  Thanks again . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 Sure . There is a changing room behind you . __eou__  Thank you . I ’ ll be right back . __eou__
 50 dollars . That's too much . __eou__  How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  It's OK . __eou__
 These postcards are great . I want to buy a dozen with different pictures . __eou__  No problem . You can choose what you like . __eou__
 OK . Here is the money . Thank you very much . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 Thank you . Goodbye . __eou__  Bye . __eou__
 Thanks , thanks a lot and thanks a million . __eou__  Why do you say so many thanks ? __eou__
 Oh , I see it now . Thanks . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  Do you know if there's a restroom around here ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Bye . __eou__
 Thanks . See you later . __eou__  Bye . __eou__
 That sounds great . I'll have that one then . __eou__  Ok , just follow me . __eou__
 Thank you . Also , how can I get my mailbox key ? __eou__  I ’ ll tell Peter to bring your key to your apartment right away . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . I ’ Ve got one more question . __eou__  No problem . Go ahead , please . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You are very welcome . __eou__
 Great . The view from this window is wonderful . __eou__  This is the kitchen . __eou__
 It looks new . __eou__  Yes . We just renovated a few month ago . __eou__
 I like it . __eou__  Here ’ s the master bedroom . __eou__
 I like it a lot but I need to talk with my wife . Can you hold it for me for two days ? __eou__  Sure . __eou__
 Good , I am sure it will work if you can persist . __eou__  I hope so . Would you like to join me ? __eou__
 Okay . Thank you very much . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll try it on . __eou__  How does that feel ? __eou__
 It feels very good . __eou__  You look wonderful . __eou__
 You look wonderful . __eou__  Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much . __eou__
 Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 Thanks , that was nice of you . __eou__  See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! __eou__
 Great . Here's my Visa Credit Card . __eou__  Here's your receipt . Thank you for shopping here and have a nice day . __eou__
 Here's your receipt . Thank you for shopping here and have a nice day . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  Is it faster if I take Highland avenue ? __eou__
 How about this one ? I think it looks terrific on you . __eou__  Yes , I like the color . Can I try it on ? __eou__
 Sure . The fitting room is on your right . __eou__  It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ? __eou__

 Why ? You said I was hot when smoking . __eou__  But I want you to be fit . __eou__
 That ’ s good . Thanks . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 I think this suit fits perfectly . __eou__  Yes , I think so . The suit matches the trousers . __eou__
 Yes , I think so . The suit matches the trousers . __eou__  It's fine . Please wrap it . __eou__
 Very nice . Thank you . __eou__  Would you like this to-go ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  You're welcome . Please come again . __eou__

 Sure ! Please just fill in your I . D . number and ways to contact you here . __eou__  Do I need to include my zip code in the address ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . Here is 500 dollars . __eou__  Here is your receipt . Contact us if your friend still doesn't receive the package after 5 work days . __eou__
Thank God , it's Friday ! Time for a drink ! Let's hit the bars ! __eou__  OK . I don't mind going bar hopping with an expert like you . __eou__
 I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special . __eou__  Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice . __eou__
 Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ? __eou__  I like to stick to the clean stuff , like vodka , gin , white rum and other clear spirits . __eou__
 Certainly . Here you are . It's a new arrival . __eou__  Yes , I like the style.Can I try this on ? __eou__
It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park . __eou__  Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym . __eou__
 Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym . __eou__  Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite . __eou__
 Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite . __eou__  That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride . __eou__
 That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride . __eou__  Look at the flowers over there . What are they ? __eou__
 It's really healthy to do some exercise there . The air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover . __eou__  Well , off we go . I am sure we can have a great time . __eou__
 Surely , of course . __eou__  Where is the fitting room ? __eou__
Oh , my god . I am so heavy now . I gain 10 kilos . __eou__  I am going to the gym . Do you want to come with me ? __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  Oh , and here are your glasses . They were next to your cell phone . __eou__
 Good habit . How long does it take ? __eou__  About 20 minutes . Do you live alone ? __eou__
 I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . __eou__  Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis ' song for him . __eou__
I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! __eou__  Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! __eou__
 It's made in China . The quality is excellent . __eou__  Please wrap it . __eou__
 Thank you . Could you change it for a purple one ? __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  Will it shrink when washed ? __eou__
 Good idea . Have you written down tea , eggs and potatoes ? __eou__  I forgot about the potatoes . Oh , I almost forget that we need a microwave oven badly . What kind of tea do you prefer ? Green tea or flower tea ? __eou__
 That's good . You can put one in this room and put the other one in that room . __eou__  Yeah , it is a good idea . You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to . __eou__
 Yeah , it is a good idea . You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to . __eou__  Yeah . By the way , can I take a shower ? __eou__
 Glad to meet you . This way , please . __eou__  The house is a little too old . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped . __eou__
 I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT ! __eou__  Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV . __eou__
 It's $ 42 ! ! That's expensive ! __eou__  Hey , let me get it for you . It's your birthday present . __eou__
 You're kidding ! __eou__  No . And then I often go Rollerblading . __eou__
 4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry . __eou__  That's OK . I'm awake now . __eou__

Yikes ! What was that noise ? __eou__  I had to blow my nose . __eou__
 I thought you had an elephant in your house . __eou__  You're funny . __eou__
 That's nice . __eou__  It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 . __eou__
 Good idea . I'll get some , too . __eou__  We also need some sunscreen . What about beach towels ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  We are arriving at Wangfujing . Please get ready . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  By the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Is it all right to smoke on the bus ? __eou__
Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! __eou__  Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . __eou__
 Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . __eou__  Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . __eou__
 Glad you like it . __eou__  Mum , when will we have them again ? __eou__
 That's very kind of you . Thank you . __eou__  We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again . __eou__
your muscles are a spectacle ! __eou__  Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise . __eou__
 Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise . __eou__  By the way , do you work out ? __eou__
Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ? __eou__  It was okay . __eou__
 Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ? __eou__  Yes . I'll be back at the same time as usual . __eou__
 Yes , that would be good ! __eou__  We need to think about what she might like . What are her interests ? __eou__
 That sounds like a good deal . __eou__  Yes , that is today's sale price . __eou__
 Oh , a cat ? Come on . __eou__  Yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . __eou__
 oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? __eou__  Yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it . __eou__
 Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . __eou__  That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . __eou__
 That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . __eou__  Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? __eou__
 Pardon ? __eou__  I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems . __eou__
 Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted . __eou__  Have you ever seen such a nice house ? __eou__
 It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood . __eou__  What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? __eou__
 That sounds just wonderful to us . __eou__  When do you want to move in ? __eou__
My dear , it's five flights up ! __eou__  That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there . __eou__
 Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . __eou__  That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? __eou__
 Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . __eou__  Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . __eou__
 Oh . Why did she do that ? __eou__  The car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our Car . __eou__
 Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? __eou__  That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . __eou__
Hey , you look great ! how's everything ? __eou__  Yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . __eou__

 Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . __eou__  OK , I'll give it a go . __eou__
Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won ! __eou__  Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . __eou__
 Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . __eou__  Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . __eou__
 Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited . __eou__  He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . __eou__
 Wounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . __eou__  And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall . __eou__
 That's good . When can I go to see the house ? __eou__  What about next saturday . __eou__
 Oh , my God ! I'm going to be late ! I have no time to have breakfast now . ( Hurry on his clothes . ) __eou__  You won't go to work today , Steven , It's Sunday . Come and have breakfast now . __eou__
 Okay . Good night . Have a good dream . __eou__  Good night . __eou__
 Oh , nice to see you . The apartment is on the tenth floor . The previous tenant just moved out yesterday . __eou__  Could I have a look at it first ? __eou__
 Good idea . I was thinking the same myself . __eou__  Tomorrow we'll go and pick out some curtains and paint . __eou__
 Great . Where is it ? __eou__  A new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the Sanlitun area . __eou__
 That's good . Is the location easily accessible ? __eou__  Yeah , it's near a bus stop . __eou__
 Yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook . __eou__  All right . __eou__
 I see . Thanks a lot . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  That's all right . Have a good day . __eou__

 We ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ? __eou__  That ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ? __eou__
 That ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ? __eou__  Sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen . __eou__
 Sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen . __eou__  That would be lovely , thanks . __eou__
 That would be lovely , thanks . __eou__  Do you take milk or sugar with your tea ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  It's my pleasure . __eou__
 That ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . __eou__  Thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? __eou__
 Thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? __eou__  Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? __eou__
 That looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? __eou__  The leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? __eou__
 That ’ s even better than the real thing . __eou__  If I were you , I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . If you spend $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . __eou__
 It ’ s ok . I ’ ll call her back latter . Thank you . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 That's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? __eou__  That's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . __eou__
 OK . I know . Thank you . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__  Do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__
 Yes , I hope so . Thank you for telling me this . __eou__  It ’ s my pleasure . __eou__
 Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . __eou__  I promise . We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . __eou__
 Ok , let's go then ! __eou__  Do you have any money ? __eou__
 Really ? I thought you hated shopping ? __eou__  I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! __eou__
 That ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ? __eou__  Here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . __eou__
 This is perfect ! What do you think ? __eou__  I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday ! __eou__

 Thanks for sharing your experience with me . __eou__  You're welcome ! __eou__

 OK , I see . Thank you very much . __eou__  You are welcome . Hope you can find it soon . __eou__
 It's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up . __eou__  How old is the house then ? __eou__
 Sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ? __eou__  It's just off of the ring road . __eou__
 Come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at it , it's beautiful ! __eou__  When you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . __eou__
 All right . How about this black skirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! __eou__  That's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . __eou__
 Oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert . __eou__  Exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it . __eou__
 Exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it . __eou__  Why not try it on ? __eou__
 Darling , I know you are a good husband . You don't have to work so hard . After all your health is the most important . __eou__  I know , darling . I must earn enough money to buy a car . I do a part-time job to increase my income . Don't worry , I will take care of myself . __eou__
 Thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . __eou__  That'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? __eou__
 Thanks . Could you tell me where I should deposit my bag ? __eou__  The checkroom is just behind the front door . __eou__
 Thank you . How much is it ? __eou__  25 yuan , please . __eou__
 I like this style , but I don't like its color . Do you have this coat in yellow ? __eou__  Yes , I will find one for you . Here you are . It's made of exceptionally good quality , pure wool , and is very soft . __eou__
 It looks nice . __eou__  Yeah , this is the latest model.If you like it , you can try it on . __eou__
We really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? __eou__  Yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! __eou__
 Yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! __eou__  Let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? __eou__
 Sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ? __eou__  I think I might have a dahl . __eou__
 It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . __eou__  That sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? __eou__
 That sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? __eou__  Ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? __eou__
 That's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ? __eou__  I think I'll have a beer . __eou__
 You're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me ! __eou__  What would you do without me ? __eou__
 Okay , I'll go take a look . Thank you so much for your help . __eou__  Don't mention it . __eou__
 Yes , I would , thank you . __eou__  Let me get the manager to sign one for you . __eou__

 Really ? __eou__  Oh yes . Like this , for example . Have you ever eaten jellyfish before ? __eou__
That was a really good meal , Gordon . __eou__  It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . __eou__
 Great . Bye . __eou__  Bye . __eou__
 Good , I like it . __eou__  You've made a good choice.This china tea set is unusual.It was made in Jingdezhen . __eou__

Wow , it all looks so good . I ’ m not sure what to choose . __eou__  I can recommend the spare ribs . They are very tasty here . __eou__
 That sounds like a good idea . It looks very big though . __eou__  Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll help you eat it . __eou__
Thank you for bringing me here . What shall we order ? __eou__  Well , it all looks so good . How about ordering the steamed prawns ? __eou__

I love Chinese food . __eou__  What's your favorite dish or dishes ? __eou__

 It was good . I brought lunch from home today . __eou__  You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . __eou__
 You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . __eou__  Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy . __eou__
 Seriously ? __eou__  Yeah , it's hard to believe but true . __eou__
 Great ! Pasta for dinner . __eou__  And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast . __eou__
Hey ! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones ! It's loaded with extras . __eou__  What does it do ? __eou__
 It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to.It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone ! __eou__  Wow ! What else does it do ? __eou__
 Wow ! What else does it do ? __eou__  I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . l can even surf the net . __eou__
 Cool ! Anything else ? __eou__  Yes.With the 600 - second digital memory , l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode . __eou__
 Wow ! __eou__  You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone . __eou__
 I think you ’ re absolutely right . Ok , that ’ s decided then ! __eou__  See you tonight . __eou__
 Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky . __eou__  Good , you can make your dream come true here . __eou__
 Good , you can make your dream come true here . __eou__  Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House . __eou__
 Bingo ! __eou__  It's just you ! __eou__
 Oh , really ? __eou__  The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too . __eou__
 Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has . __eou__  So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ? __eou__
 So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ? __eou__  I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food . __eou__

 Great . Let's go ! __eou__  Wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater . __eou__

 That sounds like a good idea . Where should I go to eat that ? __eou__  Actually , I know a great restaurant in Dongcheng . __eou__
 Ok . got it.That ' ll be $ 6.50 . Thank you for your order.it will be there in 20 minutes . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Oh , there ’ s a charge ? Why ? __eou__  This is for the delayed cancellation . Because this time is reserved for you . If you are unable to keep an appointment , you should notify us 48 hours in advance . Otherwise , the charge will be made . __eou__

 It tastes great . __eou__  Enjoy yourself . __eou__
 Enjoy yourself . __eou__  Yeah . __eou__
 Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska . __eou__  Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ? __eou__
 Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian . __eou__  God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight ! __eou__
 God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight ! __eou__  That's OK . We can go jogging , after we eat ! __eou__
 Looks good . __eou__  Would you like a shave ? __eou__
 Okay , let me brush you off . Thank you very much for coming . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Really ? You're joking . __eou__  No . I'd like to do something special for you on your birthday . __eou__
 Thank you . I think I'll take this one , and these pants as well . They're a present for a friend . __eou__  Shall I gift-wrap them for you , sir ? __eou__

 Thank you . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 What are you talking about ? My alarm hasn ’ t even gone off yet . __eou__  Yes , it did . It went off 30 minutes ago . You slept right through it . You ’ re like a dead person while you sleep . __eou__
 We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . __eou__  I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . __eou__
 True , and I like the kitchen . It's new and well equipped . __eou__  It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . __eou__
 It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . __eou__  You're right . The view is spectacular . But that bedroom is so small . We'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . __eou__
Home at last . Tonight we have a lot of homework though . __eou__  Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight ? Jane , you know I really don ’ t like our teacher all that much . He gives far too much homework . He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time . __eou__
 It looks pretty good . I think I'll take it . __eou__  Would you like anything else ? __eou__
 Thank you . Welcome to call again . Goodbye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
 Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses . __eou__  Oh , so do I . __eou__
 Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there . __eou__  Let's go ! __eou__
 Sounds pretty good . I see the equalizer has a good selection of settings . __eou__  You can also play Ccds on it if you hook it up to your TV . __eou__
 Hmm . This system seems to have everything I'm looking for . It's a bit pricey , though . I'll have to think about it . Thanks for your help . __eou__  No problem . Hope to see you again soon . __eou__
 Very well , thank you . __eou__  Please take a seat . Everything will be ready in a minute . __eou__
 Wow ! You're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper . __eou__  Here you are . Taste the French fries . __eou__

 Great . One last question . Where is your jazz section ? __eou__  Back there against that wall . __eou__
 Oh , I see it . Thanks for your help . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 Hey ! I didn't know that ! When did you become a vegetarian ? __eou__  The other day , I decided that I needed to loose more weight so I am going to try to be a vegetarian . And you know what ? I don't miss the taste of meat . __eou__
 Relly ? That's amazing . __eou__  Yes , it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy , I need less sleep , I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly . __eou__
 Are you kidding ? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet . __eou__  Yes , maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try . __eou__
 Oh , right.Thanks for your help . __eou__  Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
 I see that . That was a nice ride . __eou__  I'm glad to hear it . __eou__

 Oh , how nice ! There are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . __eou__  That is exactly what we're looking for . __eou__
 That sounds all right to us . __eou__  When do you want to move in ? __eou__
 Fine , I'll be expecting you . __eou__  See you tomorrow . __eou__
 Thanks for the warning . __eou__  That's all right . __eou__

 Thank you . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time . Is this the latest edition ? __eou__  Yes , we have both the paperback and hardcover . which would you want to buy ? __eou__
 Oh ? What's that ? __eou__  Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy . __eou__
 You refused the gift ? That's terrible . __eou__  I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . __eou__
 This seems a pretty nice room , I should say . __eou__  You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . __eou__
 You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . __eou__  What about the kitchen ? __eou__
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? __eou__  Next Saturday at the earliest . __eou__
 I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me . __eou__  You'll soon get accustomed to it . It's not difficult . Well , here's the bus.Fortunately , it's not full . __eou__
 Thank you for the information . __eou__  Don't mention it . __eou__
 Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . __eou__  But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one . __eou__
 Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  Do I need to pay any extra charge for my suitcases ? __eou__
 Actually it was the most interesting day I ’ Ve had so far . __eou__  Oh really ? Did you find any bargains ? __eou__
 I did ! I found this lovely teapot . It was the best one I saw in the shops . __eou__  And how did you get around town ? __eou__

 That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__  Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__  Good . Let's go now . __eou__
 Good . Let's go now . __eou__  All right . __eou__
 Thank you . Good bye . __eou__  Bye . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Well , there are core courses and electives . __eou__
 Dance class ! I don't know how . __eou__  You will . __eou__
Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . __eou__  How about taking a walk in the park ? __eou__
 OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . __eou__  ( After they enter the park ) Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! __eou__
 ( After they enter the park ) Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! __eou__  Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left . __eou__
Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . __eou__  I am not surprised , you eat too much . __eou__
 Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . __eou__  Not some crazy diet fat I hope . __eou__
 That sounds ridiculous . Why ? __eou__  Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . __eou__
 No problem.Step in , please . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Very good . I feel quite refreshed now ! You should come with me sometime - exercise is good for you ! __eou__  To be honest , I ’ d rather watch television ! Where did you go ? __eou__
 It ’ s very kind of you . __eou__  Smoking is harmful for your health . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow into this breathalyzer , please . __eou__  But , sir , I didn't drink at all . __eou__
 Oh , good.That ' ll be the number forty four ? __eou__  No , it's the number fifty-eight . __eou__
 Never ? __eou__  That's right.The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more.It ' s stop is round the corner . __eou__
 Really ? You are so kind . __eou__  I'll do with the cake . __eou__
 Oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . __eou__  That is exactly what we're looking for . __eou__
 That sounds all right to us . __eou__  When do you want to move in ? __eou__
 Fine , I'll be expecting you . __eou__  See you tomorrow . __eou__
 Thank you.How much is the fare to that stop ? __eou__  One dollar . __eou__
 Look ! The iron is still on . __eou__  I should have turned it off . I ’ ll turn it off now . __eou__
 Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive . __eou__  How much are they ? __eou__
 Good.Red suits me very well.It ' s a cheerful color , isn't it ? __eou__  Yes , madam , I agree.What size are you ? __eou__
 Oh , dear . What was in it ? __eou__  All my money . __eou__
 Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set . __eou__  Can I help you in anyway ? __eou__
 Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Shall I right out again first ? __eou__
 Thanks very much . __eou__  You are welcome . Good luck . __eou__
 You are welcome . Good luck . __eou__  Thank you . I won ’ t miss it . __eou__
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . __eou__  Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ? __eou__
 Nine thirty ? That ’ s no good . Couldn ’ t I have it a bit longer ? Even if I fill up the tank ? __eou__  I ’ m afraid not , Nick . That ’ s the best I can do . __eou__
 What a good idea ! __eou__  What kind shall we get ? __eou__
 Thank you.Ah ! But this is in French.Would you mind giving me the English menu ? __eou__  It's written in English too , in smaller print.There . __eou__
 Thanks . I'll need a while to choose.Could you come back in a minute ? __eou__  Right.Now , what are you having ? __eou__
 look ! they've taken your fur coat too . __eou__  I know , I am sorry I ever bought it . __eou__
Oh , there is something wrong with my car . __eou__  Your car is rather old.Why not change a new one ? __eou__
 25th Sep ? Oh , I have an appointment tonight . __eou__  What time is your appointment ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time.Is this the latest edition ? __eou__  Yes , we have both the paperback and hardcover.which would you want to buy ? __eou__
 It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ? __eou__  Of course , Sir . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 That's very clear . I think I can find my way now.Thank you . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Thank you for the information . __eou__  Don't mention it . __eou__
 Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . __eou__  But number 13 buses leave from the center of town.You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one . __eou__
 That's very kind of you . Thank you.Er ... have you got a pencil ? __eou__  Yes.Why ? __eou__
 Many thanks ! __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Then I'll walk.Many thanks . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school . __eou__  It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . __eou__
 Right . That's good . __eou__  It will be hard at first , but I think I can do it . __eou__
 Thank you , Dad . __eou__  I love you . __eou__
 I love you . __eou__  I love you , too , Dad . __eou__
 I'm grateful to you . __eou__  It's a pleasure . __eou__
Oh , so many kinds of winter hats . __eou__  What is your favorite color , miss ? __eou__
 Here you are.It ' s very attractive . __eou__  May I try it on ? __eou__
 Oh , These are exactly what I ’ m looking for . __eou__  These are French coats , sir.They are quite fashionable these days . __eou__
 This seems to be my size . __eou__  It looks good on you . __eou__
 It looks good on you . __eou__  Do you really think so ? __eou__
 Thanks , Miss . I want you to see our new stock of brocade satin , a splendid line , just came in . __eou__  No , Thanks.Not today . __eou__
 I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  I might need some tools though . Do you know where I can get some ? __eou__
 Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you . __eou__  Thanks . That would be very helpful . __eou__
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . __eou__  Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . __eou__
 Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . __eou__  OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company . __eou__
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? __eou__  My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . __eou__
 I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . __eou__  I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . __eou__
 Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__  I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__
 Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . __eou__  Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . __eou__
 What ? I gave it to you only 3 months ago . __eou__  So , you didn ’ t buy a good one for me . This time how about a better one ? __eou__
Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . __eou__  I'm OK . __eou__
 OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! __eou__  First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . __eou__
 Oh , OK . Wow ! __eou__  OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . __eou__
Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . __eou__  I feel kind of stupid . __eou__
 You got lost . You're kidding ! __eou__  No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . __eou__
 You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? __eou__  Guess where we ended up . __eou__
 Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? __eou__  I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  I'm very sorry about this . __eou__
How silly of you to jump out of the window ! __eou__  But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake ! __eou__
 Oh , really ! It looks so different . Our old place turns into a brand new place . __eou__  Do you remember our first date ? I got a really special gift . __eou__
 I can never forget that . I bought you five candies , but I was so anxious that I forgot to give them to you . You didn't get them until we parted . Then they had already melted down for I held them the whole time . __eou__  Yeah , it's really unforgettable . Thank you for making me happy all these years . __eou__
 Yeah , it's really unforgettable . Thank you for making me happy all these years . __eou__  You are the one I should thank . You've done really great job . __eou__
 OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! __eou__  First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . __eou__
 Oh , OK . Wow ! __eou__  OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . __eou__
 Wow . That sounds really good . __eou__  Mm , it is . __eou__
Daddy , I love this Happy Farmhouse . It's really fun . __eou__  Great . But no talking , now . Don't forget that you are on a ladder . Take care ! __eou__
 Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful ! __eou__  Yeah . Other than that , the real feature are the excellent drinks . Can I have your ticket ? __eou__
 Great . Let's go . Where is it ? __eou__  Patience , boy . A watched pot never boils . We shall get out fishing stuff first and make some baits , too . __eou__
 So let's go and catch earth worms ! __eou__  OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go . __eou__
 Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill . __eou__  Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ? __eou__
 Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ? __eou__  Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about . __eou__
 Yes , we do . What a great taste you have ! But we only have one left in stock . __eou__  Really ? How so ? __eou__
 Really ? How so ? __eou__  You know a good product will always sell ! Would you mind waiting for a while , we'll get it right away . __eou__
 What ? Are you kidding ? __eou__  Is there anything wrong ? __eou__
 OK ! Then what can I do after I finish it ? __eou__  Let me see . Wash the cabbage over there . __eou__
Oh , there is something wrong with my car . __eou__  Your car is rather old . Why not change a new one ? __eou__
 Three thousand ! That's almost too good to be true . Did she say why her friend wants to sell it ? __eou__  He lives in the city and you know how expensive it is to keep a car in the city . __eou__
 certainly , i love waltz very much . __eou__  you dance it very well . do you often go dancing ? __eou__
 but i can see you dance wonderfully well . __eou__  thanks for flattering me 。 i think you dance much right ? __eou__
 thanks for flattering me 。 i think you dance much right ? __eou__  no , just occasionally __eou__
 oh , i like this music very much , let's tango . __eou__  i'm afraid i can't dance well . __eou__
 Good . I wanna come with you . __eou__  How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping . __eou__
 How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping . __eou__  We learnt about vegetables and meat at school . But I never see the real thing . __eou__
 That's wonderful . He is killing two birds with one stone.Sir , please turn right at the next corner . And stop at the taxi stand . __eou__  OK ! __eou__
That's great ! We made 20 minutes earlier . __eou__  Good thing , we took a taxi . __eou__
 Good thing , we took a taxi . __eou__  Mom , you are the best ! __eou__
 Mom , you are the best ! __eou__  Hey , look there . It is an advertisement of the piano training class on the billboard . The place is not far from our home . __eou__
 Oh , my god ! We get off at the wrong stop . I'm so sorry , honey . __eou__  OK , Dad , it happens . __eou__
 Woo , your home will beautiful on Christmas . __eou__  Sure thing . __eou__
 Sure thing . __eou__  I do wish your christmas and happy new year . __eou__
 You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs . __eou__  Sure , he is a soccer star . __eou__
 Thank you . How long it take to get my son's hair cut ? __eou__  It shouldn't be long . Thirty minutes , tops . Are you in a hurry ? __eou__
 Good idea . Do you want a wash or a massage ? Massage is especially good when you are tired . __eou__  How come ? __eou__
 It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ? __eou__  Of course , Sir . __eou__
 That is exactly what we're looking for . __eou__  Well , each room is 40 dollars a week . __eou__
 That sounds all right to us . __eou__  When do you want to move in ? __eou__
 Fine , I'll be expecting you . __eou__  See you tomorrow . __eou__

 Good idea . Shall we search on line to find an appropriate one or go to a phone store ? __eou__  Maybe we can try shopping on line . __eou__
 Good idea . Shall we get everyone in the community ? __eou__  Maybe not . I think we should just focus on the retired people . __eou__
 That sounds like a good idea ! __eou__  Hey , don't forget to buy a suit for me . __eou__
 It looks so cute . Is it a parrot ? __eou__  Yes . Just look at her colorful feathers . What else can it be ? __eou__
 I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly . __eou__  Really ? A foreign parrot ! __eou__

 The weather is so crazy . It rained cats and dogs last night , but cleared up in the morning . __eou__  I was worried about canceling the climbing . __eou__

 Yeah , the scenery is beautiful . What's more , the air is fresh here ? __eou__  So you wanna stay here ? __eou__
Do you know how happy I am ? The Ant Kingdom is a perfect world with colorful fairy tales . It seems like the air is fresh here . __eou__  Just kids like that . __eou__
 Hurry up ! Hurry up ! What lovely caterpillars are over there ! __eou__  I said you are sure to like them . There is the Grand Parade Of Ants Carnival in a few minutes in the square . You will experience a dream of fantasy . __eou__
 That's splendid . Can you take three pictures of me with them ? __eou__  I thought you had grown out of such child practices . __eou__
Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it . __eou__  It is called Energy Collector . __eou__
 Maybe . Oh , I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it . It was very exciting . __eou__  I want to have a try later . __eou__

 It's very kind of you . __eou__  It's not a big deal.Hey , I found them . __eou__
 It's not a big deal.Hey , I found them . __eou__  Oh , thank God ! I don't know how to thank you , guys . __eou__
 Oh , thank God ! I don't know how to thank you , guys . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 No , thanks Mom . I'd like some toast and chicken wings . __eou__  Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . __eou__
 Really ? You were so happy then . __eou__  Aren't you happy now ? I hadn't seen the piano when I was a child . __eou__
 The park is so beautiful . It is a good thing I have taken the camera . __eou__  Dad , I'd like to take a picture with the status . __eou__
 Cute ? Hope so . __eou__  Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it . __eou__
 Haha , very funny , but it doesn't make any sense to me . __eou__  That's all right . At least I got myself left . __eou__
 What ’ s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny ! __eou__  Actually , they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . They are like Tangun . __eou__
 Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert . __eou__  Yes . And also , we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings . __eou__
Daddy , I am so glad you come out with us . __eou__  Honey , I am sorry that I am too busy most of the time . __eou__
 Cool , we can take the football , shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park . __eou__  Hooray ! I can play football with daddy . Mom and sister can play badminton . __eou__
 Hooray ! I can play football with daddy . Mom and sister can play badminton . __eou__  After that , we will have a picnic . __eou__
 That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . __eou__  Okay , it sounds good . __eou__
The tea smells good . What tea is it ? __eou__  It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . __eou__
 Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut . __eou__  I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best . __eou__
 Really ? How to do that ? __eou__  Take some pictures of the thing you want to sell , then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number . Then your stuff will be sold by auction . __eou__
 That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ? __eou__  Let's click to check it out . __eou__
 Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets . __eou__  No doubt about it . Shopping online will get more and more popular . It's a real revolution about people's consuming habits . __eou__
 I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel . __eou__  Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason . __eou__
 Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing . __eou__  I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ? __eou__
 Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! __eou__  Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne . __eou__
 Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it . __eou__  It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly . __eou__
 That's really nice . I'd like this one . It looks very attractive . __eou__  What would you like for appetizer and dinner ? __eou__
 Oh , my wife just threw them into the washer . __eou__  Did it ever shrink or fade ? Generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually . __eou__
 Oh , thanks . You know , I know little about this , so please tell me something that I should pay more attention to when I do washing . __eou__  It's very simple . Divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . If you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know . __eou__
 Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt . __eou__  It doesn't seem like that . Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  Hope to see you again . We will provide the best service . __eou__
 Why not ? I'd love to do that . __eou__  Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . __eou__
 Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? __eou__  Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? __eou__
 Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ? __eou__  The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back . __eou__
Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool . __eou__  I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too . __eou__
 I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too . __eou__  Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . __eou__
 Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . __eou__  Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . __eou__
 Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ? __eou__  Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist . __eou__
 It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing . __eou__  Here we go . __eou__
 Hey , How did you know I came from America ? __eou__  Just a hunch , sir . __eou__
 That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . __eou__  Sorry , sir . __eou__
 That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . __eou__  DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY ? __eou__
 That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ? __eou__  Of course not , sir . __eou__
I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine . __eou__  I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time . __eou__
 I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time . __eou__  Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty . __eou__
 Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty . __eou__  We are nor alone here . So many other families ! __eou__
 We are nor alone here . So many other families ! __eou__  Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings . __eou__
 Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings . __eou__  Well , let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn . __eou__
 Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ? __eou__  Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys . __eou__
 Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ? __eou__  He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do . __eou__
 Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic ! __eou__  I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world . __eou__
 Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ? __eou__  Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings . __eou__
 My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? __eou__  Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? __eou__
 You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? __eou__  Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today . __eou__
 Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel . __eou__  I am going there , too . We can walk together . __eou__
 He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he , eight ? __eou__  Yes . He's never said anything so I never told him . But now that he's getting older ... __eou__
 Oh , you are such a good child today . Come here . Sit next to me . __eou__  I'm afraid I can't do that . It's Dad's seat , according to the book about table manners . __eou__
 Great . That's my favorite seat which will be the nearest to the birthday cake . __eou__  Now I see what you read the book for . But it's fine . I'll give you the lion's share . __eou__
 Oh , it's interesting . Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn . __eou__  Yeah . We are the VIP customers here . So , what do you want to eat today ? __eou__
 Great , I want it spicy . __eou__  Come on . Don's go too far . __eou__
What ? Your golden watch is lost ? __eou__  Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . __eou__
Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want . __eou__  You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting . __eou__
 Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! __eou__  You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . __eou__
 You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . __eou__  Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . __eou__
 Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . __eou__  Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? __eou__
 Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? __eou__  Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please . __eou__
 We are lucky to play in a new stadium . __eou__  Hurry up , Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me . I'm good at shooting . __eou__
 Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ? __eou__  Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well . __eou__
 Really ? You must be ... __eou__  But that game he dunked over me for 13 times . __eou__
 Sounds interesting . Especially that we are Olympic Volunteers . __eou__  That's exactly what I am thinking about , And also it's a good way to get social experiences . __eou__
 That's exactly what I am thinking about , And also it's a good way to get social experiences . __eou__  And a good way to get some pocket money . __eou__
 And a good way to get some pocket money . __eou__  Let's do it together . __eou__
 Oh , my God ! __eou__  What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles ! __eou__
 It's my pleasure , what can I do for you ? __eou__  I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today . __eou__
 OK , it's my pleasure . How many tickets ? __eou__  Oh , like a gentleman . Two tickets for two people . __eou__
 Thanks a lot for calling us . Could you tell me more about what you need us to do ? __eou__  Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there . __eou__
 Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ? __eou__  I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . __eou__
 I usually come with a group of friends . We dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time . __eou__  Yeah , that's why I'm here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying . __eou__
 That's good . It's good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while . __eou__  I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don't mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I'll do it in a park . __eou__
 I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . __eou__  Um , ninety-five dollars ? __eou__
 Sure . I love going to the mall . __eou__  What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ? __eou__
 You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? __eou__  No , Officer , not at all . __eou__
I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . __eou__  Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? __eou__
 Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . __eou__  Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . __eou__
 So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting ! __eou__  Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . __eou__
 That ’ s good . Will you tell me the details ? __eou__  Certainly , you need to pay a deposit at first , and you will pay the rest monthly . __eou__
 Really ! So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ? __eou__  It ’ s $ 240 a month . __eou__
 Oh , wow , that's cool . Um , why do people keep pets ? __eou__  I guess the most important thing is companionship , right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what . __eou__
 I guess the most important thing is companionship , right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what . __eou__  Yeah , that's true . OK , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ? __eou__
 Out ? What do you mean out ? __eou__  You know on a date , they are going out to dinner . __eou__
 Oh , no ! Did you call the police ? __eou__  No . __eou__
 She is beautiful . __eou__  Is she old or young ? __eou__
 She is quite young and her hair is blond . __eou__  Is she strict ? __eou__
 Not really . Her eyes are blue . __eou__  Can she speak Chinese ? __eou__
 Not much . She is very tall and slim . __eou__  David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework . __eou__
 But thank you very much all the same . __eou__  Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you . __eou__
 That'll be helpful . All right , thank you . __eou__  Please make a single-breasted . __eou__
 Thank you , see you then . __eou__  Bye-bye . __eou__
 An apartment ? Why ? __eou__  I'm going to try to find a place near the office . __eou__
 Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it . First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the skin and there ’ s a peeler . __eou__  Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small . ... wow ! You can chop vegetable really quickly , just like professional chefs on TV ! __eou__
 You forgot ? You ... __eou__  Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ? __eou__
 Really ? You are so kind . __eou__  I'll do with the cake . __eou__
 Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? __eou__  No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . __eou__
 It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ? __eou__  Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large-that ’ s the fashion . __eou__
 There . It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter . __eou__  I ’ m getting this beret – doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me . __eou__
 Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down . __eou__  When did it first break down ? __eou__
 Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! __eou__  It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! __eou__  Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster ! __eou__
I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here . __eou__  License and registration please . Have you been drinking tonight , sir ? __eou__
Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . ' __eou__  It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . __eou__
 It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . __eou__  Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! __eou__
 Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! __eou__  Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! __eou__
 Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! __eou__  A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! __eou__
 A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! __eou__  The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! __eou__
 The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! __eou__  Great play ! __eou__
 Great play ! __eou__  We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! __eou__
 We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! __eou__  Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! __eou__
 Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good ! __eou__  Great ! Can you set the table ? __eou__
 Great ! Can you set the table ? __eou__  Just a sec I ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast __eou__
Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! __eou__  What is that ? __eou__
 A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! __eou__  Cool ! __eou__
 Cool ! __eou__  Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . __eou__
 Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . __eou__  What about all these other pieces ? __eou__
 See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . __eou__  And these two ? They are husband and wife ? __eou__
 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? __eou__  Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! __eou__
 Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light ! __eou__  Whatever . Just turn right here . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . let ’ s take a side street . Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! __eou__
 Yes ! We made it . 5 fifty-eight , just before the library closes . __eou__  You ’ re such a geek ! __eou__
 What do you mean ? __eou__  You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . So we are taking you into custody . __eou__
 I didn't do anything . __eou__  We've found some heroin at your house . __eou__
 No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . __eou__  That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . __eou__
 What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! __eou__  Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . __eou__
 What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? __eou__  I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . __eou__
 Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . __eou__  Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense . Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? __eou__
 What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? __eou__  The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot . __eou__
 Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean . __eou__  Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ? __eou__
 Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ... __eou__  Sounds good . Okay , that ’ s it . __eou__
 Sounds good . Okay , that ’ s it . __eou__  Wait ! We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . They are very fresh ! Just came from the slaughter house ... __eou__
Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? __eou__  Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . __eou__
 Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ? __eou__  Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up . __eou__
 Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . __eou__  You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! __eou__
 Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks ! __eou__  Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top . __eou__
 Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! ( starts cutting ) Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! __eou__  Um ... no . __eou__
 Finally ! __eou__  I ’ m sorry , sir . I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag . __eou__

 Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . __eou__  Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__
 Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__  It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__
 It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__  Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! __eou__

 A crate of beer ? Why do we need that ? __eou__  Just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil . __eou__
 That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? __eou__  Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . __eou__
 I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them . __eou__  Sure . There you are . __eou__
 Yes . He ’ s so energetic . We take him out to the park every morning and evening . I think he ’ d be happy to stay there all day ! __eou__  I ’ m sure he would . We usually have to drag him home . __eou__
 Your cat spends most of the day outdoors ' , right ? Do you kino where she goes ? __eou__  She spends less time outdoors and she used to . we have no idea where she goes . She ’ s very secretive . Occasionally , she brings back a dead mouse . __eou__
 I thought he usually wrote horror books . __eou__  He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read . __eou__
 Of course . I made apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . __eou__  I love you home made apple pie . It ’ s delicious . Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? __eou__
 I love you home made apple pie . It ’ s delicious . Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? __eou__  Sure . Can you get it yourself ? It ’ s in the refrigerator . __eou__
 That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ? __eou__  Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ? __eou__
 Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week . __eou__  That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet . __eou__
 I can ’ t wait to start cooking ! I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal . Do you have enough plates and utensils ? __eou__  I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up ! __eou__
 I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ? __eou__  I don ’ t like it . It takes up too much time and I really hate having to clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up , and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . __eou__
 That ’ s right . They tastes so good ! We eat them with mint sauce . Have you every tried them ? __eou__  Yes , I have . I tried them when I visited your country last year . I thought they were very tasty . Can you cook them ? __eou__
 I certainly can . If I can get some from the butcher ’ s , I ’ ll cook them for you . __eou__  That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine . __eou__
It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . __eou__  Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . __eou__
 Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . __eou__  The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! __eou__
 The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! __eou__  Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play . __eou__
 Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play . __eou__  It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . __eou__
 It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . __eou__  Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break . __eou__
Welcome back racing fans ! My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my partner in crime , Bob Copeland . __eou__  We ’ re in the last stretch of this very exciting race , and Kimmi Rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall ! __eou__
 We ’ re in the last stretch of this very exciting race , and Kimmi Rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall ! __eou__  He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track . __eou__
 He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track . __eou__  The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go ! __eou__
 The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go ! __eou__  Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead ! __eou__
 Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead ! __eou__  How unlucky for Rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , Alonso takes the checkered flag ! __eou__
 I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . __eou__  I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . __eou__
 Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something . __eou__  Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting . __eou__
The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? __eou__  I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself . __eou__
 I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? __eou__  You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . __eou__
 Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are . __eou__  I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It ’ s on sale , isn't it ? __eou__
 I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you buy any new furniture ? __eou__  I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . __eou__
 I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition . __eou__  That ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . __eou__
 That ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . __eou__  I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day . __eou__
 That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to put all the furniture in your room . __eou__  I ’ d like to have the bad and the wardrobe . __eou__
 Yes , it would . It ’ s very expensive though . __eou__  Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount furniture store . __eou__
 I like them very much . We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds . __eou__  Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ? __eou__
 I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often . __eou__  Why is it relatively expensive ? __eou__
 Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine . __eou__  A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . __eou__
 Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . __eou__  My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? __eou__
 My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? __eou__  Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out . __eou__
 It ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look . __eou__  Oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling . __eou__
 That ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand . __eou__  Yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon . __eou__
 No problem . That ’ s one dollar extra . __eou__  Thanks very much . There ’ s thirteen dollars . __eou__
 Thanks very much . There ’ s thirteen dollars . __eou__  There ’ s you receipt . Goodbye . __eou__
 Where ’ s my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet ! __eou__  Perhaps it ’ s in your other pocket . __eou__
 Ok . Got it . Thanks for you help . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 What a good idea ! __eou__  What kind shall we get ? __eou__
 Sure can . __eou__  Thanks a lot . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  Bye . __eou__
 Bye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
 I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling ! __eou__  I wish I'd put it in the bank . __eou__
 Look ! they've taken your fur coat too . __eou__  I know , I am sorry I ever bought it . __eou__
 Thanks very much . __eou__  You are welcome . Good luck . __eou__
 You are welcome . Good luck . __eou__  Thank you . I won ’ t miss it . __eou__
 Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher . __eou__  Oh , what ’ s she like ? __eou__
 She is beautiful . __eou__  Is she old or young ? __eou__
 She is quite young and her hair is blond . __eou__  Is she strict ? __eou__
 Not really . Her eyes are blue . __eou__  Can she speak Chinese ? __eou__
 Not much . She is very tall and slim . __eou__  David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework . __eou__
 I ’ ll be glad to help . __eou__  Or maybe make the beds . __eou__
 All you have to do is ask for help . __eou__  Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! __eou__
 Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! __eou__  I ’ m ready and willing to help . __eou__
 What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . __eou__  Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . __eou__
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . __eou__  Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ? __eou__
 Thank you . Ah ! But this is in French . Would you mind giving me the English menu ? __eou__  It's written in English too , in smaller print . There . __eou__
 Thanks . I'll need a while to choose . Could you come back in a minute ? __eou__  Right . ( five minutes later ) Now , what are you having ? __eou__
 What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! __eou__  Oh ... __eou__
 Oh , dear ! __eou__  What's the matter ? __eou__
 That sounds ideal . Can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision . __eou__  Of course . I'm not very busy at the moment . If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . I can take you there . __eou__
 Of course . I'm not very busy at the moment . If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . I can take you there . __eou__  Thank you . That would be great . __eou__
 Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . __eou__  Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . __eou__
 I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . __eou__  The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . __eou__
 The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . __eou__  Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . __eou__
 Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . __eou__  It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice . __eou__
 The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too . __eou__  Yes , everything has been well designed . __eou__
 Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! __eou__  So , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? __eou__
 How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ? __eou__  I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now . __eou__
How beautiful the flower is ! __eou__  Really , it's so beautiful . __eou__
 Really , it's so beautiful . __eou__  You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . __eou__
 You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . __eou__  You mustn't pick it in this place . __eou__
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? __eou__  Next Saturday at the earliest . __eou__
 Here you are . Thank you and goodbye . __eou__  You are welcome , sir . Good-bye . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Would you like a shampoo first ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  All right , madam , it's your turn . What will it be today ? __eou__
 It's great ! Will it be hard to care for ? __eou__  Not at all . When you wash it , it will fall into place naturally . You'll probably need another cut in about a month . Shall I make an appointment for you ? __eou__
 Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ? __eou__  Next Friday . __eou__
 Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ? __eou__  I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight . __eou__
 Certainly . __eou__  Good that way . I can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting . __eou__
 Very well . Thank you . __eou__  You're welcome , sir . __eou__
 Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ? __eou__  $ 280 . __eou__
 Yes , that's fine . I'll take it . Can I pay by check ? __eou__  Of course , madam . __eou__
 It looks nice . How much is it ? __eou__  They're three hundred dollars . __eou__
 OK , I'll take it . Here's the money . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Good . Red suits me very well . It's a cheerful color , isn't it ? __eou__  Yes , madam , I agree . What size are you ? __eou__
 Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ? __eou__  Oh , spinach , I think . __eou__
 Good . Thank you.sir . __eou__  Would you like to have some more beer ? __eou__
 No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please . __eou__  Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it . __eou__
 I wear size 32 . This one looks nice . Where may I try it on ? __eou__  Come this way . Here's the dressing room . __eou__
 It looks nice . And it's not expensive . __eou__  How much is it ? __eou__
 Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ... __eou__  Along Queen's Road ... __eou__
 That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ? __eou__  Yes . Why ? __eou__
 Of course , yes . They look nice . And they're not expensive . __eou__  How much are they ? __eou__
 It's very considerate of you to do so . Do you have any laundry today ? __eou__  I have a suit that needs cleaning . __eou__
 Oh , yes ! __eou__  Do you know if she's read this one ? __eou__
 Certainly . Let me see . Oh , it's on that self . __eou__  It's too high . I can't reach it . Could you help me ? __eou__
 Of course . Here you are . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Here's the receipt . __eou__  Thank you so much . __eou__
 Thank you so much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time . Is this the latest edition ? __eou__  Yes , we have both the paperback and hardcover . which would you want to buy ? __eou__
 Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ? __eou__  One dollar . __eou__
 Of course . Here you are . __eou__  Then , what's special tonight ? __eou__
 Oh , good . That'll be the number forty four ? __eou__  No , it's the number fifty-eight . __eou__
 I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me . __eou__  You'll soon get accustomed to it . It's not difficult . Well , here's the bus . Fortunately , it's not full . __eou__
 Thank you for the information . __eou__  Don't mention it . __eou__
 Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . __eou__  But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one . __eou__
 That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it . __eou__  I'm so happy that you found what you wanted . Do you want to use a credit card ? __eou__
 I'm so happy that you found what you wanted . Do you want to use a credit card ? __eou__  Sure . Wait , wait . Does a lid come with this pan ? __eou__
 Sure . Wait , wait . Does a lid come with this pan ? __eou__  Oh , I'm sorry . Here's the lid . Yes , it comes with the pan . __eou__
 Your budget is a good idea . __eou__  I know . It's going to save me a lot of money , I hope . __eou__
 Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! __eou__  What sort of pest are we dealing with ? __eou__
 Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ? __eou__  No , not really ... I ’ m completely at a loss . __eou__
 Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! __eou__  Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question ! __eou__
 Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question ! __eou__  Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . __eou__
 That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you . __eou__  I'll just buy the shirt . __eou__
 Let me feel your forehead . I'm so glad it wasn't strep throat . __eou__  I don't have a fever , and I'm ready for my test . __eou__
 But I'm not sure you're strong enough yet . Here's some seafood rice soup I made . It's delicious . __eou__  I'm fine , Mom . I feel so much better . I want to go to school . I'm missing out on all the fun . __eou__
 That's a lot of money ! What did you do ? Break the piggy bank ? __eou__  Yeah , I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills , but first I have to separate them into little piles . __eou__
 Great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank . __eou__  I found some coins that are not from here . __eou__
 Oh yeah , those are from my trip to London . I have a couple of different pence , but in all it won't add up to one pound . __eou__  Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you ? __eou__
Johnny , I want to thank you . __eou__  What do you mean , Mom ? For breaking your best china ? __eou__
 Oh , Johnny , that stuff was dollar store junk . No , I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy . __eou__  Well , it's more like she kept me busy ... __eou__
 I know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . So , thank you . __eou__  Am I back in your good books ? __eou__
Mom ! __eou__  What are you doing ? __eou__
 I'm playing with my new jump rope ! Watch this ! __eou__  You are sick , young lady . Get back in bed ! I called you in sick today , so you're going to lie down and fight that flu ! __eou__
 You are sick , young lady . Get back in bed ! I called you in sick today , so you're going to lie down and fight that flu ! __eou__  But I feel better . __eou__
Guess what , Gilly ? I won both bids . __eou__  Good for you . Did you use Paypal ? __eou__
 Good for you . Did you use Paypal ? __eou__  Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast , once I figured it out . __eou__
 That's the beauty of it , and the danger . __eou__  I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Gao . We appreciate your letting us have the apartment . __eou__  My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ? __eou__
 My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ? __eou__  The ad said rent was thirty thousand . That includes utilities and phone , I assume . __eou__
You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome ! __eou__  Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing . __eou__
 Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing . __eou__  That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing . __eou__
 That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing . __eou__  Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere ! __eou__
 Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere ! __eou__  Come on baby , let's dance ! __eou__
 Come on baby , let's dance ! __eou__  Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down ! __eou__
 That's so sweet of you . We definitely want it . __eou__  I thought so , by the looks on your faces when you left . So why don't you come to my apartment , and we'll settle all the details . __eou__
 Great . When in Rome , you guys know what to do . __eou__  We'll sign our signatures , too . And give you our passport numbers along with our ARC numbers . __eou__
 Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head . __eou__  Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time . __eou__
 I'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much . __eou__  And I'll stick with real coffee . __eou__
 Yeah , time for more coffee ! __eou__  Sure , why not ? I think I want a chocolate chip cookie , too . __eou__
This is a very spacious apartment . It's forty pings , including the parking space . That's about one thousand four hundred square feet . __eou__  Wow . It's just the two of us . I don't know if we need that much room . __eou__
 Exactly , which is why a three-bedroom is better . And look , there are two bathrooms . __eou__  Now that's a plus ! __eou__
 Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out ! __eou__  How much did that end up costing you ? __eou__
 Hey , two for one . That's a super deal . __eou__  And here's her signature ! __eou__
 Just like in the States ! That's perfect ! __eou__  And I recently bought an American-style washer and dryer . Come and see . __eou__
I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer ! __eou__  I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator . __eou__
 I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator . __eou__  This is too good to be true . __eou__
 This is too good to be true . __eou__  And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ? __eou__
 And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ? __eou__  Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too . __eou__
 Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too . __eou__  It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ? __eou__
 It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ? __eou__  We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors . __eou__
They're here ! Now that's speedy service ! And they arrived within two days of each other ! __eou__  What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open ! __eou__
 What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open ! __eou__  Wow ... this shirt is nice , but looks big . __eou__
 It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ? __eou__  With the shipping included--seventy dollars . __eou__
 Oh ! The view is great ! Mountains , fresh air ! Stars ? __eou__  This balcony is perfect for barbecuing . __eou__
 This balcony is perfect for barbecuing . __eou__  And we could get a dog ! __eou__
 And we could get a dog ! __eou__  I'm sorry . No pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish . __eou__
Great . My favorite-soup , soup , soup ... __eou__  Oh , and there's one more thing you have to do every hour on the hour , sweets . __eou__
Johnny , I can't believe you would do that . __eou__  I know , Grandma , I just ... __eou__
Steve , thanks for looking after Johnny . __eou__  It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson . __eou__
 It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson . __eou__  And this kitchen is so clean . Did you help Johnny with that ? __eou__
 That's great . And the garbage , too ? __eou__  Yeah , uh , it's outside . Listen , I really have to be going now . __eou__
Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome ! __eou__  It's more violent than TV news ! __eou__
 It's more violent than TV news ! __eou__  What time is it anyway ? __eou__
 Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done ! __eou__  No time . That's their headlights in the window ! __eou__
 Sure , if you're done ! __eou__  All my games are so lame , Mom . When can I get a new one ? __eou__
 It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food , so I thought you might want to try . __eou__  That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish . __eou__
 That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish . __eou__  Well , Indian cuisine actually doesn ' t serve beef . You see , cows are a sacred animal , a very important element in the Hindu religion , so beef is not eaten . __eou__
 Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food . __eou__  Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice . __eou__
 They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal . __eou__  It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait ! __eou__
 I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory .

 Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! __eou__  Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . __eou__

Don ’ t you have air-conditioning in your apartment ? It ’ s sweltering here ! __eou__  Well , there is air-conditioning . Did you see that window air conditioner there ? The problem is that the window unit isn ’ t powerful enough . __eou__
Gosh ! The water faucet is dripping badly again . __eou__  You are going to have a huge bill . __eou__

 Thank you . How much do I owe you ? __eou__  You owe me 19 dollars . __eou__
 That's 20 dollars . Keep the change ! __eou__  Thank you ! __eou__
 No problem , Madam . Should I check the air in the spare tyre as well ? __eou__  I don't think so . It's brand-new . __eou__
 Sure . What is it ? __eou__  Can you keep an eye on my bag , please ? Nature's calling . __eou__
 Sure . Will you be long ? __eou__  No , I just want to use the bathroom . __eou__
 You ’ Ve gone through all your money so quickly ? I thought you were well-off . __eou__  Not me . You know money always burns a hole in my pocket . __eou__
 Yeah . That ’ s a good idea and you like to cook . What about the books ? __eou__  No , I need my books . __eou__
 Really ? Well . Ok . Get the receipts out . __eou__  Let's see . We spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment , 400 on groceries , 75 on utilities , 250 on gasoline , 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month . __eou__
 Sure , just a minute . Are you an artist , sir ? __eou__  No , I am a teacher . I teach art . __eou__
 That must be a very interesting job . __eou__  It is . You must be new here . I do my shopping here regularly , once a week . __eou__
 Do you ? Nice to meet you ! And here is the invoice and your change . __eou__  Thank you . Nice to meet you , too . __eou__
 Ok , thank you . __eou__  You are welcome ! __eou__
 As many as you like , sir . They are beautiful , aren't they ? __eou__  Yes , they are . __eou__
 Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow to the breathalyzer , please . __eou__  But sir , I didn't drink at all . __eou__
 Yes , certainly , madam . __eou__  It smells sweet . __eou__
 It smells sweet . __eou__  Yes , it is . This perfume just arrived yesterday , and it's the latest products of Chanel . __eou__
 Really ? How much is it ? __eou__  55 dollars , madam . __eou__
 Thank you . Do you need something else ? __eou__  No , thanks . __eou__
 Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ? __eou__  That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ? __eou__
 Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color . __eou__  That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for . __eou__
 Sure . What is it ? __eou__  Could you run over to the store ? We need a few things . __eou__
 Certainly . What can I do for you ? __eou__  I'm looking for a leather belt for my husband . __eou__
 Yes . I'm sure he will . I'll take it . __eou__  Will this be cash or charge ? __eou__

 It's my pleasure . See you . __eou__  Hi , Basil . __eou__
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? __eou__  My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . __eou__
 I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . __eou__  I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . __eou__
 Here you are , sir . I ’ m sure she ’ ll enjoy them . __eou__  Finally ! __eou__
 Finally ! __eou__  I ’ m sorry , sir . I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag . __eou__
 Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? __eou__  First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . __eou__
 I know . He bought me that beautiful sweater for my birthday . It was exactly what I wanted . And it fit me perfectly ! __eou__  he bought me an iron . __eou__
 yes , I do . Let ’ s go . We should be able to find something suitable . We should get him something old ... something historic . __eou__  it ’ ll be an expensive present , but we can share the cost . __eou__
 I ’ ll be happy to get him something special , even if it coasts a little extra . __eou__  yes . He always get us special gift . We should repay his kindness . __eou__

 thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? __eou__  yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . __eou__
 thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet . __eou__  how much do are you looking to spend ? __eou__
 thank you . I'll be sure to take a look . __eou__  good luck . __eou__
 Yes , I like this one.It goes very well with my coat . How much is it ? __eou__  It's $ 9.95 . Do you want me to put it in a box ? __eou__
that was a really good meal , Gordon . __eou__  It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . __eou__

 Cindy , you're so cute . __eou__  she is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? __eou__
 Oh , a cat ? Come on . __eou__  yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . __eou__
 oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? __eou__  yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it . __eou__
oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people . __eou__  Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? __eou__
 come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at that , it's beautiful ! __eou__  when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . __eou__
 all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! __eou__  that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . __eou__
 oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert . __eou__  exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it . __eou__
 exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it . __eou__  why not try it on ? __eou__
 it sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare . __eou__  stirred or shaken ? __eou__

 an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . __eou__  Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . __eou__
 Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . __eou__  look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . __eou__
 that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . __eou__  that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . __eou__
 why ? anything special there ? __eou__  it's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . __eou__
 Oh , really ? are there any snakes ? __eou__  snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . __eou__
 snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . __eou__  that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . __eou__
 that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . __eou__  Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? __eou__
 why not ? it's so cool . __eou__  but it will pose a risk to your health . __eou__
 pardon ? __eou__  i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems . __eou__
 Good . By the way , who's going to cook the meat ? __eou__  You'll cook it of course ! __eou__
 sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . __eou__  and you can still go " window shopping " just like in a real shopping mall . __eou__
 sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of . __eou__  perhaps I should have a try . __eou__
 Oh dear , is it really my turn ? In that case , I'll clean tomorrow . __eou__  Clean it now . Only lazy people say they'll work tomorrow . __eou__
 Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food ! __eou__  Humph ! Right , so what did you get ? __eou__

 Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . __eou__  When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? __eou__
 That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . __eou__  That ’ s right .

 Excellent ! We have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices.How about we get you measured ? Let ’ s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . Now , let ’ s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here . __eou__  Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? My neck gets easily irritated . __eou__
 No problem ! Now for your pants , let me just measure your waist and the inseam . __eou__  You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays . __eou__

 That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ? __eou__  No , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels .

 Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications . __eou__  You mentioned you have a dog , most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care , pet shops and even pet sitters ! __eou__
 That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? __eou__  Well , I also have ... __eou__
I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious ! __eou__  I was worried you would think it was too far to drive . __eou__
 Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! __eou__  Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . __eou__
 Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese ! __eou__  I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ? __eou__
 Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . __eou__  And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . __eou__
 I wonder if you can cook things this good . __eou__  I'm a great cook actually . You will see . __eou__
 Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! __eou__  There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . __eou__
 Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . __eou__  Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . __eou__
 Thanks.Okay . I have my soap . __eou__  My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ? __eou__
 My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ? __eou__  I don't know . I want my clothes to be clean . __eou__
 Thanks . My name's Nick . __eou__  I'm Alice . I guess I'll have to be your mother for today . __eou__
 Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good ! __eou__  Great ! Can you set the table ? __eou__
 Great ! Can you set the table ? __eou__  Just a sec I ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast . __eou__
 Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? __eou__  Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . __eou__
Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? __eou__  Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . __eou__
 Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ? __eou__  Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up . __eou__
 Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up . __eou__  Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . __eou__
 Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . __eou__  You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! __eou__
 You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! __eou__  You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg ? __eou__
I really appreciate your driving me around . __eou__  It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place . __eou__
 It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place . __eou__  It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all . __eou__
 That's good . __eou__  Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture . __eou__
 That sounds alright . __eou__  Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them . __eou__
 Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this . __eou__  Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ? __eou__
 Kreng ? I've never heard of that company . __eou__  It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone . __eou__
 Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ? __eou__  Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks . __eou__
 Of course . __eou__  It sounds great . I'll take it . __eou__
 It sounds great . I'll take it . __eou__  Fine . I think you'll be happy with it . It's a very good unit . Very reliable . I'll go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment . __eou__
 Fine . I think you'll be happy with it . It's a very good unit . Very reliable . I'll go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . __eou__  No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . __eou__
Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I & __eou__  NO ! __eou__
 Sure , that sounds good . __eou__  Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ? __eou__
 Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ? __eou__  No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust . __eou__
 Perfect . Thank you . Bye .. __eou__  wait ! ! I need your address ! __eou__
 Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time . __eou__  Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot . __eou__
 This is a Porsche ! __eou__  Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__
 You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal . __eou__  Can I return the car in San Francisco ? __eou__
 Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities . __eou__  No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot . __eou__
 Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it . __eou__  It's a beautiful drive . __eou__
 It's a beautiful drive . __eou__  Where are the keys ? __eou__
 Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__  I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__
 Days ? __eou__  Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . __eou__
 Oh ... wow . That ’ s really pretty.Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ? __eou__  We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her . __eou__
 Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! __eou__  Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question ! __eou__
 Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question ! __eou__  Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . __eou__
 Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? __eou__  No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . __eou__
 Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ? __eou__  I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . __eou__
 Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . __eou__  Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me over for dinner this evening . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 You're welcome . __eou__  It looks delicious . __eou__
 It looks delicious . __eou__  Well here . Help yourself to some shrimp . It's fresh . __eou__
 Oh , good . __eou__  How much will it cost ? __eou__
 Oh , well thank you very much . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 Hi , David . What a beautiful necklace ! Dude , I ’ Ve never seen anything like it . __eou__  Well , you can have it for eleven hundred — as a friend . __eou__
 What ? Seven hundred ? __eou__  Well , eight hundred , then ? __eou__
 What a large child ! __eou__  All my children are large . __eou__
 What an agile child ! __eou__  All my children are agile . __eou__
 What for ? For the party , of course . __eou__  Party ? What party ? __eou__
 $ 520 a month ? We don ’ t often have apartments as inexpensive as that.We have one apartment for $ 599 a month , on Seventh Avenue . It ’ s near the station . __eou__  Is it furnished ? __eou__
 Engaged ? She ’ s married . __eou__  Johnny , I wish you ’ d stop reaching for things . Haven ’ t you a tongue ? __eou__

 Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are . __eou__  I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It ’ s on sale , isn't it ? __eou__
 Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain . __eou__  I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ? __eou__
 Wow . You guys never take a break ! I want to come in and have a look at your sale . Your sale is still on , isn't it ? __eou__  Yes , it runs till the end of the month . But things are clearing out fast . __eou__
 Ok , I'll come down tonight . Thanks . __eou__  Thank you for calling . __eou__
 That's fine . __eou__  Thanks for calling . __eou__
 Oh , you mean Canal Street ? __eou__  That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown . __eou__
I'm looking forward to our son's graduation this weekend . __eou__  Yes . So am I . But what will he do after graduation ? He really needs to go to college . __eou__
 No ! He hit me first . __eou__  I don't care . You know better than to hit him . Go sit on your bed for 10 minutes . __eou__
 You stopped just in time . Good for you ! __eou__  I braked as hard as I could . __eou__
 it's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up . __eou__  how old is the house then ? __eou__
 it's about 200 years old . It has a lot of history ! __eou__  sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ? __eou__
 sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ? __eou__  it's just off of the ring road . __eou__
 no , what is it ? __eou__  it's deep fried vegetables , which is commonly eaten in Japan . __eou__
 that sounds great . Do you know if there are any vegetable dishes that are spicy ? __eou__  let me think . You could get an Indian or Thai vegetable curry , or you could get some Kimchi . __eou__
 Yes . Thank you . __eou__  Would you care for a drink before you order ? __eou__
 I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? __eou__  Well , I feel a little tired . __eou__
 Well , most importantly the apartment is beautiful . __eou__  How much is the rent for the apartment ? __eou__
 Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there . __eou__  It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ? __eou__
 It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ? __eou__  I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter . __eou__
 There.It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter . __eou__  I ’ m getting this beret ? Doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me . __eou__
 I ’ m getting this beret ? Doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me . __eou__  Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later . __eou__
 Small ? But it should be enough for our needs , I think . __eou__  But there's no hot water after 10 at night.Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good . __eou__
 It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . __eou__  You are right.The view is spectacular.But that bedroom is so small.We ' d never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . __eou__
This apartment is wonderful . __eou__  I ’ m glad you like it . __eou__
 I ’ m glad you like it . __eou__  How much would I have to pay for rent ? __eou__
 I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ? __eou__  I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . __eou__
 Yes . I can feel the difference in material . There ’ s not much difference in price . Ok , I ’ ll take the more expensive one . __eou__  Fine . I ’ ll measure you for the suit ... shoulder ... waist ... inside leg ... forearm ... upper arm ... thank you . I ’ ll prepare the suit for you tomorrow . Could you come again the day after tomorrow just to check that the su __eou__
 Thank you very much , sir . I ’ ll put the shirts and jacket into a bag for you . __eou__  Thank you very much . I ’ ll see you the day after tomorrow . __eou__
 Sounds good . I'll see you at 6 . Do you want directions ? __eou__  I'm okay , thank you . I already checked out the address on MapQuest . __eou__
 I'm okay , thank you . I already checked out the address on MapQuest . __eou__  If you like the place , you can fill out an application form . I'll bring one with me . __eou__
 That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ? __eou__  No . Just bring yourself . __eou__
 Great , thanks . __eou__  Can I help you ? __eou__
 Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ? __eou__  Is this Friday okay ? __eou__
 I ’ m fine , thank you . __eou__  Did you need help with something ? __eou__
 Very good . We'll meet at 6 . Do you need directions ? __eou__  No , thank you . I go by there on my way to work . __eou__
 That's a good idea . Do I need to bring anything myself ? __eou__  No . The only thing I need to see is your driver's license . __eou__
 I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . __eou__  There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ? __eou__
 I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing . __eou__  It is . I love it . __eou__
 It is beautiful . __eou__  You don ’ t have any problems with how it looks ? __eou__
 Well , I ’ m glad that everything else is to your liking . __eou__  I honestly love it . __eou__
 Friday at 6 pm . would be perfect . __eou__  That will be fine . __eou__
 That will be fine . __eou__  Thanks for your help . __eou__
 I absolutely love the apartment . __eou__  Everything is okay ? __eou__
 I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice . __eou__  It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it . __eou__
 That ’ s great . __eou__  How much is the rent ? __eou__
 That would be fine . __eou__  Great . It was a pleasure doing business with you . __eou__
 That will be good . You are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away . __eou__  I could use some help on moving day . What are you doing on Saturday ? __eou__
 Great . I'll see you at 6 . Do you know where it is ? __eou__  Yes , I have a friend who lives in that neighborhood . __eou__
 That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away . __eou__  Can you help me on my move-in day ? __eou__
 No , thanks . I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like . __eou__  I'll have an application form with me . You can fill it out if you're interested . __eou__
 actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . __eou__  my pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? __eou__
 my pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? __eou__  yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out . __eou__
 That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room . __eou__  I ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe . __eou__
 I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ? __eou__  I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . __eou__
 new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . __eou__  do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ? __eou__
 that ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . __eou__  I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day . __eou__
the bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? __eou__  I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it mys __eou__
 I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? __eou__  you ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the information I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . __eou__
 That ’ s right.They taste so good.We eat them with mint sauce.Have you ever tried them ? __eou__  Yes , I have . I tried them when I visited your country last year . I thought they were very tasty.Can you cook them ? __eou__
 I certainly can.If I can get some from the butchers , I ’ ll cook them for you . __eou__  That sounds great . I ’ ll boring a bottle of wine . __eou__
 I can ’ t wait to start cooking . I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal.Do you have enough plates and utensils ? __eou__  I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use.It will save on the washing up . __eou__
 excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down . __eou__  when did it first break down ? __eou__
 Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it.First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the sink and there is a peeler . __eou__  Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small.Wow , you can chop vegetables really quickly __eou__
 Thanks , Mom.Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake . __eou__  No dessert for you unless you eat all of your vegetables . __eou__
 Of course . I made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . __eou__  I love your home-made apple pie.It ’ s delicious.Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? __eou__
 I love your home-made apple pie.It ’ s delicious.Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? __eou__  Sure.Can you get it yourself , it ’ s in the refrigerator . __eou__
 That ’ s great to hear . __eou__  How much are you looking to rent it for ? __eou__
 That would be wonderful . __eou__  Can you tell me how much I would have to pay for rent ? __eou__
 That ’ s almost perfect . __eou__  I can live with that too . __eou__
 I ’ m glad to hear that . __eou__  How much are you asking ? __eou__
 An excellent idea . Work now and play later . __eou__  I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed . __eou__
 I ’ m happy to hear you say that . __eou__  How much are you asking for every month ? __eou__
 Really ? I can ’ t believe you actually found an apartment in the ads . __eou__  I actually found it in the ads , and it ’ s not too expensive either . __eou__
 Really ? You are joking ? __eou__  No , I'd like to do something special for you on your birthday . __eou__
 Oh , really ? Where ’ d you find it ? __eou__  I was looking through the ads today , and I found it in there . __eou__
 First of all , it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . __eou__  What is the rent each month ? __eou__
 That ’ s amazing . The rent is very cheap . __eou__  I know it is . __eou__
 I know it is . __eou__  It ’ s a good thing that you read that ad today . __eou__
 Very well , thank you . __eou__  Please take a seat . Everything would be ready in a minute . __eou__
 Wow , you're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper . __eou__  Here you are . Taste the French fries . __eou__
 No more , thank you . __eou__  Here is to our friendship and health ! __eou__
 Here is to our friendship and health ! __eou__  Bottom is up . __eou__
 Couldn't get connection ? __eou__  Yes , your number is out of service . __eou__
 Really ? I didn't know . Let me check . You're right . __eou__  So I couldn't get through . __eou__
 That's right , mutton chops taste so good , we eat them with sauce , have you ever tried ? __eou__  Yes , I have , I tried once when I visited your country last year , I think they were very tasty.Can you cook them ? __eou__
 Yes , I have , I tried once when I visited your country last year , I think they were very tasty.Can you cook them ? __eou__  Certainly I can , I'll buy some from butchers ' and cook for you next sunday . __eou__
 Certainly I can , I'll buy some from butchers ' and cook for you next sunday . __eou__  That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine then . __eou__
Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ? __eou__  Well , not everyone wants to drink beer . Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . Nothing ’ s as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day . __eou__
 It does sound wonderful , maybe I'll try it . __eou__  Is there anything else ? Maybe I can interest you in one of fine appetizers , such as the escargot . __eou__
 Good , and would you care for soup or salad to start with ? __eou__  I'd like cream onion soup please . __eou__
 I want to skip desert.That all , thank you . __eou__  OK , I'll be with you in a moment . __eou__
 Then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale . Two for one . __eou__  You're right , that is great . __eou__
 You're right , that is great . __eou__  What size would you like ? __eou__
 Medium one will be perfect , thank you __eou__  Which kind do you want ? __eou__
 Tuna sounds good today . __eou__  Would that be for here or take away ? __eou__
 That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks . __eou__  That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ? __eou__
 Nice to meet you . My name ’ s Sophie . __eou__  Are you French ? __eou__
 Thanks you . __eou__  Look ! Here it is ! __eou__

 Thank you . Yes , I would . __eou__  These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored . __eou__
 It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ? __eou__  Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new . __eou__
 well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . __eou__  that's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! __eou__
 that's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! __eou__  so , are you going to quit driving to work then ? __eou__
 that sounds ideal . can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision . __eou__  of course . i'm not very busy at the moment . if you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . i can take you there . __eou__
 Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too . __eou__  I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . __eou__
 I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . __eou__  The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . __eou__
 The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . __eou__  Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . __eou__
 Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . __eou__  It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice . __eou__
 The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too . __eou__  Yes , everything has been well designed . __eou__
that was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook . __eou__  I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ? __eou__
 I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ? __eou__  I don't know . I'm pretty full . What are we having ? __eou__

 Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? __eou__  I'll have a cup of tea . __eou__
 skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go . __eou__  what happened ? __eou__
 what happened ? __eou__  I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up . __eou__
 that's good of you . why did you decide to get a rabbit . __eou__  well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , I wanted a pet that would be affectionate . __eou__
 that sounds pretty easy . Do rabbits make your house smell ? __eou__  No , rabbits aren't very stinky . As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . __eou__
 that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ? __eou__  not yet . She's pretty tame . I think she must be used to being around lots of different people . __eou__
I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap . __eou__  I know and they are really nice , too . __eou__
 definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters . __eou__  how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ? __eou__
 Well , here you are . Size six . Woman's . 137 dollars.Wow , what a waste of money ! __eou__  It's none of your business . Let me try them on . __eou__
 I've always got room for something sweet ! __eou__  what are you going to try first ? __eou__
 that sounds good . I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu . __eou__  do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece . __eou__
 do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece . __eou__  ok . Mmm . __eou__
 it's nice , but it's rather plain . Do you want to try my tiramisu ? __eou__  sure . I'll just have a bite . __eou__
 sure . I'll just have a bite . __eou__  what do you think ? Does it taste good ? __eou__
 it's absolutely delicious ! That is the best tiramisu I've ever had ! __eou__  I'm glad you like it . I don't care for it . Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas ? __eou__
 I'm glad you like it . I don't care for it . Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas ? __eou__  ok . I've had one of those before . They're really sweet and crunchy . __eou__
 yeah , why not ? We've already pigged out as it is ! __eou__  ok , I'll be back with two fried bananas in a few minutes . Wait for me here ! __eou__
 Alright , sir . You are making a good choice.Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . __eou__  What does it come with standard ? __eou__
 Why not , sir ? __eou__  I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? __eou__
 That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? __eou__  We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver.These are the standard colors.Of course you could specially order from various other colors too . __eou__
 Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then.It looks like an excellent car . __eou__  You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . __eou__
 You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . __eou__  Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else.The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . __eou__
 It looks good on you . __eou__  I look like a nerd . __eou__
 Don't worry about that . Your English seems very good.And our instruction manuals are very clearly written . It's easy ! __eou__  Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ? __eou__
 Well , you made a good choice . Coming to us , I mean.We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . __eou__  What do you have in foundation ? __eou__
 Wow ! That's expensive . __eou__  What you're paying for , Ma'am , are the ingredients.It is a very high quality product . __eou__
 Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . __eou__  He would think you were crazy , Caroline . __eou__
 I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? __eou__  I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street . __eou__
 Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? __eou__  She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears . __eou__
 DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ? __eou__  It is very similar . The technology is the same . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now . __eou__
 I beg your pardon ? Who ’ s climbing the tree . __eou__  Tim is . __eou__
 Thanks , Dan . __eou__  What are you going to do now , George ? __eou__
 Pink ! __eou__  This bookcase isn ’ t for me . It ’ s for my daughter , Susan . Pink ’ s her favorite colour . __eou__
 But my sister bought this pair last month . __eou__  Did she buy them here ? __eou__
 Twenty years ! That's a long time . __eou__  Yes , I have been here since 1976 . __eou__
 That's a lot of money ! __eou__  It's worth every penny of it . __eou__
 Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students . __eou__  I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . __eou__
 Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? __eou__  Yes . It's an excellent system . __eou__
 Yes . It's an excellent system . __eou__  Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? __eou__
 What ? Are you serious ? __eou__  Yes . __eou__
 But nobody uses Macintosh ! __eou__  That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma __eou__
 Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . __eou__  You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . __eou__
 Alright . You are the expert . I'm happy to have your recommendation . __eou__  So I will cut the sides just above the ear . Is that good ? __eou__
 Great . I would be happy to try it . I know my hair doesn't look good now . It's too weak . __eou__  The problem is the split ends . __eou__
 Why ? __eou__  Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . __eou__
 that would be great . I really only want to taste real Chinese food , not just the food that foreigners like to eat ! __eou__  if you haven't tried Beijing duck yet , I'd like to treat you to a meal at a famous duck restaurant near Qianmen . It would be a pity if you left without tasting it ! __eou__
 Sure , Carolyn . I'm happy to help you.What kinds of things do you need right now ? __eou__  Well , we have most of the furniture already.We mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.And Albert wants to set up a little off __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ? __eou__
 I see . Thanks for these tips . We really need to buy a lot of little things . __eou__  I know how it is . Moving is very troublesome . __eou__
 Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me . __eou__  Please show me your receipt again . __eou__
 Store credit is okay with me . I'm sure I will find something I like . I shop here a lot . __eou__  We appreciate your business , Ma'am . __eou__
 I really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good ! __eou__  how often do you usually cook ? __eou__
 you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup . __eou__  that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat . __eou__
 that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat . __eou__  thanks , but I'll stick with some jasmine tea . I'm trying to watch my diet . __eou__
 I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears . __eou__  automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . __eou__
 that ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . __eou__  I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece . __eou__
 Right ! __eou__  I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little . __eou__
 Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful . __eou__  Ahahah , and I thought you were tired . __eou__
 Ahahah , and I thought you were tired . __eou__  You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses . __eou__
 In that case , I'm with you . Em.this is good . __eou__  I agreed , Hi , guess what ? I went bungee jumping last weekend . __eou__
 Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch . __eou__  True . ok Let's go to Grumose ? __eou__
Wow , Amy , look at that number . __eou__  What's so great about it ? __eou__
 What do you mean ? It's a scrim . __eou__  Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that . __eou__
 I love that kind of stuff . __eou__  Yeah , you seem to like those styles . __eou__
 Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ? __eou__  Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit . __eou__
 that smells great . I'll take one bottle , please . __eou__  would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . __eou__
we really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? __eou__  yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! __eou__
 yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! __eou__  let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? __eou__
 that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? __eou__  ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? __eou__
 that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ? __eou__  I think I'll have a beer . __eou__
 you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me ! __eou__  what would you do without me ? __eou__
 haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black . __eou__  why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything ! __eou__
 that ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . __eou__  thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? __eou__
 thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? __eou__  yep . Here it is . What do you think ? __eou__
 that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? __eou__  the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? __eou__
it ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! __eou__  we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ? __eou__
 we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ? __eou__  that ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ? __eou__
 that would be lovely , thanks . __eou__  do you take milk or sugar with your tea ? __eou__
 really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . __eou__  well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! __eou__
 no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time ! __eou__  oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count ! __eou__
 Oh ! Ha-ha ! That's not what I mean when I said ' go Dutch ' ! __eou__  Huh ? What were you talking about , then ? __eou__
 Thanks very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 that ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? __eou__  sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . __eou__
 sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . __eou__  I promise . We ’ re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . __eou__
 ok , let ’ s go then ! __eou__  do you have any money ? __eou__
 you said you were only going to window shop ! __eou__  I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! __eou__
 Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit . __eou__  really ? so you don't have fried food at all . __eou__
 really ? so you don't have fried food at all . __eou__  not really . I may have some occasionally for a chance . But I don't indulge myself too much . __eou__
 that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . __eou__  me , too . What did you have in mind ? __eou__
 I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " . __eou__  is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? __eou__
 oh , they look nice . May I try that back one on ? __eou__  of course . The fitting room is right over there . __eou__
 really ? I'll take it , and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ? __eou__  our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number . __eou__
 thanks . Who much would that come to ? __eou__  let me see ... __eou__
Boris , look at this sentence . " Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . " It's interesting , isn't it ? __eou__  I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those " strict nutrition philosophies " about ? __eou__
 Seriously ? __eou__  Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so . __eou__
 dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new ! __eou__  well , what do you have in mind ? __eou__
 oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It was so spicy my eyes teared up ! __eou__  maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base . __eou__
 sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well . __eou__  yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines . __eou__
 great . Let's go ! __eou__  wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater . __eou__
 thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . __eou__  Just roll it up and have a bite , Amy . __eou__
 oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? __eou__  certainly . First , a Beijing duck is specially selected . After it is cleaned and dressed , it will be roasted in an open oven . Only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique __eou__
 it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great . __eou__  Yes , Amy , please have some more . __eou__
 I did ? __eou__  You didn't see the red light ? __eou__
 I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars . __eou__  We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room . Let ’ s offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars . __eou__
 That sounds good , but I don ’ t want this house to get away from me . __eou__  The market is fairly down right now , so the offer is a realistic one . __eou__
 No problem . We can do it right now . __eou__  Are you buckled up ? __eou__
 You're going to kick me out over this ? __eou__  Exactly , maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules . __eou__
 That sounds good ! Please bring me one of those . __eou__  Would you like that drink blended or on the rocks ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You're welcome . Let me know if you need anything else . __eou__
 You want to throw me out over this ? __eou__  That's right , maybe then you'll respect my rules . __eou__
 I would love a margarita right now ! That is what I am going to order . __eou__  Can I prepare your drink on the rocks , or would you prefer it blended ? __eou__
 I thought you were making dinner tonight . __eou__  I do all the cooking . __eou__
 Thanks . I'm going to go take a nap . __eou__  Would you like me to come get you when the food is done ? __eou__
 You're not going to make anything to eat ? __eou__  You never cook . I always do . __eou__
 You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff . __eou__  What do they have ? __eou__
 Sure , no problem . Is your prescription ready ? __eou__  I think so . It should be . __eou__
 Thank you so much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 I actually like the food there . __eou__  Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ? __eou__
 I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great . __eou__  We can eat at the cafeteria . __eou__
 The food there is pretty good . __eou__  What kind of food do they serve ? __eou__
 The food there is wonderful . __eou__  I go to Sons for my groceries . __eou__
 It's very good , and it's fresh too . __eou__  I do my shopping at Sons . __eou__
 That sounds pretty good . __eou__  I like it , and it's a fast meal . __eou__
 That is a very quick meal to make . __eou__  I can make it for you if you like . __eou__
 That sounds like a great breakfast . __eou__  It's good , and it's easy to make . __eou__
 It's good , and it's easy to make . __eou__  That sounds like a very quick meal . __eou__
 That sounds like a very quick meal . __eou__  So , are you still going to have cereal ? __eou__
 A teriyaki bowl sounds nice . __eou__  I don't know how to make that . __eou__
 That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ? __eou__  The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice . __eou__
 That sounds delicious and nutritious . __eou__  You should try it . You won't be disappointed . __eou__
 They have the freshest foods there . __eou__  I usually shop at Sons . __eou__
 Whole Foods is way better than Sons , trust me . __eou__  I'll take your word for it . __eou__
 That does sound pretty good . __eou__  I know it does , and that's because it is . __eou__
 That's a good idea . __eou__  It's not time consuming at all . __eou__
 That sounds like a plan . __eou__  Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ? __eou__
 That sounds really good . __eou__  When are you going to make it ? __eou__
 Apple pie is my favorite . __eou__  I love apple pie too . __eou__
 I love apple pie too . __eou__  See , I helped you out . __eou__
 My absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple . __eou__  That sounds really good to me right now . __eou__
 That sounds really good to me right now . __eou__  I'm happy to help . __eou__
 Sounds good to me . __eou__  Where can we go to get both ? __eou__
 That's how you want it ? __eou__  Yeah , that sounds delicious . __eou__
 Yeah , that sounds delicious . __eou__  Okay , I'll grill some corn then . __eou__
 That sounds good . __eou__  I guess I can do that . __eou__
 Sure , I'll go get it for you . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Anything for you . __eou__
 That sounds great . __eou__  Did you want fries with your order ? __eou__
 No , thank you . That's it . __eou__  No problem , that'll be $ 5.48 . __eou__
 No problem , that'll be $ 5.48 . __eou__  Thanks a lot . Keep the change . __eou__
 Okay , thank you very much for your help . __eou__  No problem . Thank you for being so understanding . __eou__
 No problem . I'll do that for you . __eou__  I really appreciate you doing this for me . __eou__
 I really appreciate you doing this for me . __eou__  It's no problem at all . __eou__
 Okay , thanks for everything . __eou__  You're welcome , and I apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__
 Thanks , I appreciate your help . __eou__  Thank you for all your patience . __eou__
 Yes , that sounds great . __eou__  Well , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials . __eou__
 The apple crisp sounds great . __eou__  Since there are four of you , would you like to split a second dessert ? __eou__
 Good suggestion . Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks , please ? __eou__  Would you like coffee or tea with your dessert ? __eou__
 Our meal was absolutely perfect ! __eou__  How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal ? __eou__
 Dessert sounds perfect , but I would like to split something with my friends . __eou__  On this evening's dessert list , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp . __eou__
 I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful . __eou__  One dessert will serve two , so would you like to split a second one ? __eou__
 Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . __eou__  Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ? __eou__
 Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? __eou__  There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table . __eou__
 You know , that is one of my favorites ! __eou__  OK , I'll take one order of that . __eou__
 That'll be fine for now , thank you . __eou__  Okay , tell me when you want to order the rest of your food . __eou__
 No , thank you , that'll be all for now . __eou__  Okay , let me know when you're ready to order your food . __eou__
 No , that's it , thank you . __eou__  No problem , call me when you're ready to place the rest of your order . __eou__
 Hi Mary . We are really looking forward to a great meal here . __eou__  Can I interest you in an appetizer to start out ? __eou__
 That would be a great choice ! __eou__  I'll trust your taste and take one order of that . __eou__
 Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . __eou__  Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ? __eou__
 Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? __eou__  There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table . __eou__
 You know , that is one of my favorites ! __eou__  OK , I'll take one order of that . __eou__
 That sounds like a good choice for me . May I have one , please ? __eou__  Can I bring that to you on the rocks , or would you like it blended ? __eou__
 That sounds delicious . __eou__  So are you planning on cooking it ? __eou__
 That's a good idea . __eou__  Do you know what you want to drink ? __eou__
 What do you mean ? __eou__  When you're thirsty , you're not supposed to drink soda . __eou__
 I really like apples and grapes . __eou__  What kind of apples do you like ? __eou__
 I love green apples . __eou__  I don't like green apples . __eou__
 Really ? Why not ? __eou__  Green apples are too sour for me . __eou__
 Yeah , I love red apples . __eou__  I think green apples are a lot better . __eou__
 Why is that ? __eou__  Soda isn't good for you . __eou__
 That sounds good . __eou__  It's a lot better than soda . __eou__
 Why not ? __eou__  Soda is really bad for you . __eou__
 I've always liked green apples . __eou__  I don't really like green apples that much . __eou__
 Why do you say that ? __eou__  I think they are too sour . __eou__
 I really like Caesar salads . __eou__  Caesar salads are pretty good . __eou__
 Caesar salads are pretty good . __eou__  What kind of salad do you want to make ? __eou__
 That sounds really tasty . __eou__  You should make a salad like that . __eou__
 Those taste really good . __eou__  Which kind of salad are you going to make ? __eou__
 I enjoy chicken salads . __eou__  I like salads with croutons , almonds , and shredded cheese . __eou__
 I really like how that sounds . __eou__  Why don't you make a salad like that ? __eou__
 I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order . __eou__  Let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp . __eou__
 Oh , that all sounds so good ! Can we get the sauce on the side ? __eou__  Yes , we would be happy to prepare the food to meet your special needs . __eou__
 That is an excellent choice , and I could bring you your salads now or bring them with your dinner . __eou__  Please bring our salads to us now . We are hungry ! __eou__
 Caesar salads are good . __eou__  I like those too . __eou__
 I like those too . __eou__  What kind do you plan on making ? __eou__
 Chicken salads are really good . __eou__  I always make my salads with shredded cheese , croutons , and almonds . __eou__
 That sounds like a great salad . __eou__  Why don't you put it in your salad ? __eou__
 This all looks good ! I think we know what we want . __eou__  Please let me point out the chef's special , which is blackened catfish . __eou__
 We are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs . __eou__  Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian ? __eou__
 Not at all . It's no problem . __eou__  Thank you so much . __eou__
 Thank you so much . __eou__  It's no trouble at all . __eou__
 No big deal . I'll do it for you . __eou__  Okay , thanks a lot . __eou__
 Okay , thanks a lot . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 It was really fun chatting with you . __eou__  It was really nice talking to you too . __eou__
 It was really nice talking to you too . __eou__  Have a good one . __eou__
 Have a good one . __eou__  I'll have a good day once this day is over . __eou__
 I enjoyed talking to you . __eou__  I liked talking to you too . __eou__
 Saturday is perfect . What time would you like ? __eou__  Is 11 __eou__
 I greatly appreciate this . __eou__  Don't mention it . __eou__
 I want you in bed , right now , so sweet dreams . __eou__  Fine . Sleep well yourself . __eou__
 You don't know what happened ? __eou__  What did happen ? __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  I wouldn't lie about something like that . __eou__
 I'm glad to know that everyone made it out okay . __eou__  Me too . __eou__
 Nobody told you what happened ? __eou__  Tell me the news . __eou__
 Are you kidding ? __eou__  I am completely serious . __eou__
 That's great to hear . __eou__  Yes , it is . __eou__
 You haven't heard about it ? __eou__  No , don't you know what happened ? __eou__
 You didn't see it ? __eou__  I honestly couldn't see it because of the bushes growing over it . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  No problem . Next time , just pay closer attention . __eou__
 Did I really ? __eou__  You didn't know ? __eou__
 You didn't know ? __eou__  I had no idea that I ran it . __eou__

 Thank you for returning my call . __eou__  What was your call about ? __eou__
 Exactly what did he do ? __eou__  Even though I asked him not to , he kept speaking out in class . __eou__
 Oh , hi . Thanks for getting back to me quickly . __eou__  Why did you call me ? __eou__
 What do you mean ? __eou__  He was talking and causing a disturbance during class . __eou__
 That sounds pretty good to me , but I am not sure what to do . __eou__  You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer . __eou__
 What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ? __eou__  Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list . __eou__
 They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let ’ s see what the inside looks like . __eou__  I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here . __eou__
 Signing the registry is a good idea . I think I want to see the kitchen next . __eou__  I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day . __eou__

 I love the beautiful lawn . What a great front entryway ! __eou__  We need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor knows we were here . __eou__

 That's perfect . __eou__  Okay , so Friday at what time ? __eou__
 I'm pretty good . __eou__  Do you think you can teach me ? __eou__
 There are a lot of papers ! __eou__  We are going to go through these bit by bit . You will have plenty of time to read the fine print . __eou__
 I feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers . __eou__  Don ’ t worry about how many papers there are . We are going to look at them one at a time . __eou__
 We could try that , but I really want this house ! __eou__  It is common practice to offer and then have a counter-offer . __eou__
 Thanks for your help . __eou__  You need to turn that in at Window B . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  You're welcome . Turn the application in at Window B . __eou__

 I don't understand why I can't just pay you . __eou__  We have to make sure that the person issued the ticket is the one paying it . __eou__
 I don't understand why you would do that . __eou__  There was nowhere to park , and I needed to run in and get something . __eou__
 Why can't I just give you the money for the fine ? __eou__  Because , I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are . __eou__
 Really ? What did you get one for ? __eou__  I parked in the red zone . __eou__

 Splendid . Will there be anything else ? __eou__  No , the roses will be fine . __eou__
 I just thought I would ask . __eou__  When you buy a Model T , you can't expect a warranty . __eou__
 I don ’ t understand why . __eou__  I ’ m going to have to keep your deposit __eou__

 But the semester just started ? Why the rush ? __eou__  After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again . __eou__
 Me ? Why me ? Why not you ? __eou__  We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about . __eou__
 Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ? __eou__  Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . __eou__
 You want to be a politician ? Yuck . __eou__  That's not like you to generalize . __eou__
I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job . __eou__  Congratulation . What will you do ? __eou__
 Congratulation . What will you do ? __eou__  They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese . __eou__
 That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do . __eou__  It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up . __eou__
 Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . __eou__  I am sure we will . __eou__
 Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? __eou__  You ’ Ve put it among these journals . __eou__
 Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . __eou__  Are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__
 I am 100 % certain . __eou__  According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . __eou__

 No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? __eou__  Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . __eou__

 Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from . __eou__  I had Professor Mahoney . __eou__
 Why ? What happened ? __eou__  Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . __eou__
 Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . __eou__  Ouch . You must be very disappointed . __eou__
 Really ? Why ? __eou__  She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time . __eou__
 That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . __eou__  I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . __eou__
 That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help . __eou__  No problem , man . __eou__
 Good luck . __eou__  Thanks . See ya . __eou__
 It was great ! How was your year ? __eou__  It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ? __eou__
 It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ? __eou__  Yes , I'm dating someone . Her name is Amanda . __eou__
 Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__  Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__
 How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__  That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__
 That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . __eou__  You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__
 I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other . __eou__  That will be great . __eou__
It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters . __eou__  What do you mean by that ? __eou__
 Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . __eou__  You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything . __eou__
 Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? __eou__  That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . __eou__
 That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . __eou__  I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . __eou__
 I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . __eou__  And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . __eou__
 And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . __eou__  Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer . __eou__
 Great . Maybe we can study and play games together . I think we can be good friends . __eou__  Yeah . Anytime . __eou__
 I see . Thank you very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 OK . I see . Thank you . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__

 Good . See you later . __eou__  Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
 Oh my God , don't you know that such living environment is not healthy ? __eou__  Yes , we do . That's why we have a cleaning every three months . __eou__
 Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__  You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . __eou__
 I really admire you for that . How is it going ? __eou__  It ’ s going all right . I ’ m learning some things for the first time , but I ’ m also brushing up on some things that I already know . __eou__
 Oh , yeah ? __eou__  Yes , it ’ s exciting . This month we are doing crossword puzzles . __eou__
 Oh , I didn't know that . __eou__  Sure . Here is the code number , with information on how to use it . __eou__
 Thank you . So you think I will be able to get in with this ? __eou__  Sure . Just call the touch-tone registration system again.Then , follow the directions on the sheet . You will get in no problem . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  Next time you come in here , I will recognize you . __eou__
 Really ? That's great to know . __eou__  That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible . __eou__
 Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job . __eou__  I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors . __eou__
 That would really help me a lot . I'm very grateful . __eou__  Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students . __eou__
 That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . __eou__  Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard . __eou__
 What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old ! __eou__  Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ? __eou__
 That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ? __eou__  Usually it's two dollars off the cover price . __eou__
 This pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts.And twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet.The Bucky Card has just started.Every couple months we have new businesses joining our program.It ' s a great way for students to save money ! __eou__  Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ? __eou__
 Whoa ! That's expensive ! It should be cheaper . __eou__  But think of how much money you'll save ! You can use it for a year . __eou__
Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you ! __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 On the level ? __eou__  I ’ ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating . __eou__
 Closed ? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes . __eou__  Well , that ’ s not possible . The computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . And that ’ s what our budget is based on . Who told you that anyway ? __eou__
 Serious ? Only the proof of my address . __eou__  Yes , I am afraid she gave you the wrong information . __eou__
 It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly . __eou__  Well , do you all major in the same subject ? __eou__
 Great ! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books ? __eou__  Sure.But you can only keep them for a week . __eou__
 Fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . __eou__  That's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? __eou__
 That's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? __eou__  Yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  For detailed information , however , you should read a history book . __eou__
I've been looking forward to the new semester . __eou__  I hope we can make great progress in this new semester . __eou__
 I hope we can make great progress in this new semester . __eou__  Hope so . __eou__
 Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . __eou__  I am sure we will . __eou__

 Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ? __eou__  Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now . __eou__
 OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you ! __eou__  Yeah , you too ! __eou__
Wow ! Look at all these books ! I bet I can find a book about anything here ! __eou__  Shih ! ! Please keep your voice down . There are people reading and studying here . __eou__
Hey , Wen ! Welcome to D . C . ! Glad you came out to visit ! __eou__  Thanks for inviting me . Actually , I've never been anywhere with so many black people before . It's different . __eou__
 Great ! Is your , too ? __eou__  Sorry , nope . But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight . __eou__
 Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . __eou__  Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . __eou__
 Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . __eou__  We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . __eou__
 We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . __eou__  I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . __eou__
 I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . __eou__  That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . __eou__
 That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . __eou__  I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . __eou__
 I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . __eou__  A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . __eou__
 A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . __eou__  I ’ m sure that will be very popular .. OK , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice . __eou__
 That sounds good . __eou__  Ok . Let ’ s go ! __eou__
 Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__  Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__
 A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__  One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__
 It was great . I had a really good time . __eou__  What classes did you have ? __eou__
 Yes ... with flying colors ! __eou__  What does that mean ? __eou__
 It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well ! __eou__  If you like the class this much already , I ’ m sure you will . __eou__
 not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework , __eou__  no wonder you like the class so much . __eou__
 She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . __eou__  What kind of things did you learn ? __eou__
 She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . __eou__  Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? __eou__
 Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? __eou__  If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it . __eou__
 Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ? __eou__  Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__
 Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books . __eou__  Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ? __eou__
 Gosh ! __eou__  That's too much for us really . __eou__
 Very nice . Thank you for your time . __eou__  Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . __eou__
 I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here . __eou__  Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly . __eou__
I passed history test . __eou__  Really ? That ’ s marvelous ! __eou__
 Really ? That ’ s marvelous ! __eou__  And then you ’ re old man won ’ t be beaten this time . __eou__
 And then you ’ re old man won ’ t be beaten this time . __eou__  I ’ Ve made up my mind not to be beaten again . __eou__
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ? __eou__  I am afraid so . I am terribly sorry ! __eou__
 Okay . Thank you . I understand now . __eou__  Will there be anything else ? __eou__
 Really ? Do you think English is that important ? __eou__  Of course it is.In fact , I'll even take the course with you if you want . __eou__
 Great ! It's always better to do things with a friend . __eou__  Do you have the phone number ? I need to call for registration . __eou__
 Forget it ! That's what friends are for ! Besides , I have a VIP card for a discount . __eou__  Good job ! This is going to be a great night ! __eou__
 Good job ! This is going to be a great night ! __eou__  I think so too.Let ' s go ! __eou__
 That's a good idea . Thanks a lot . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! __eou__  Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ? __eou__
 I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend . __eou__  Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams ! __eou__
 Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams ! __eou__  Thanks , bye . __eou__
 She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English . __eou__  Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing . __eou__
 Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing . __eou__  I think it's a good way to develop our language ability . __eou__
 I think it's a good way to develop our language ability . __eou__  Actually , our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us . __eou__
 In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! __eou__  OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . __eou__
 Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? __eou__  Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . __eou__
 Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! __eou__  But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . __eou__
 Really ? Is there a foreign teacher for every class ? __eou__  It depends . If they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us . __eou__
 That sounds interesting . I'll go with you tomorrow evening . __eou__  You won't be disappointed . __eou__
 Mario and I are the best students in the class.Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__  Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__
 Yeah , I've been looking forward to it for ages . __eou__  What do your classmates think of it ? __eou__
 They give me a lot of congratulations . __eou__  How long will you study there . __eou__
 Good luck ! __eou__  Thank you ! __eou__
 It's huge ! __eou__  Yeah . They're usually this big . __eou__
 The craftsmanship is excellent . __eou__  All the parts work . __eou__
 Thank you so much . __eou__  Don't mention it . __eou__
 You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . __eou__  I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . __eou__
 Science ? That's a surprise . __eou__  Surprise ? __eou__
 Surprise ? __eou__  I thought you would like PE . __eou__
 Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it . __eou__  Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly . __eou__
 Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in . __eou__  Hope so . __eou__
 Good . See you later . __eou__  Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
 OK.Thank you very much for your trouble . __eou__  No trouble at all . So long . __eou__
 Gosh ! __eou__  That's too much for us really . __eou__
Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again . __eou__  Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ? __eou__
 That would be a lot of help . __eou__  Follow me , please . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes , really . __eou__
 That would be great . __eou__  I ’ m going to need you to complete this application . __eou__
 What a great idea ! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with ! __eou__  The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English . __eou__
 That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ? __eou__  I don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends ! __eou__
 You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding ! __eou__  I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . __eou__
 That sounds easy enough . __eou__  Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about . __eou__
 Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? __eou__  Yeah . __eou__
 Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' __eou__  Exactly . __eou__
 A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__  One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__
 But , you were born and raised in California ! __eou__  Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . __eou__
 What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? __eou__  You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . __eou__
 Ok , cool . __eou__  Good . I'll give you a call tonight . __eou__
 Good . I'll give you a call tonight . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  Bye . __eou__
 Yes , thank you . That would be great . __eou__  Well , then , I'll talk to you later . Have a good day ! __eou__
 Really ? How can I do that ? __eou__  Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance . He will pay you for them . Are you going today ? __eou__
 No , thanks . I'm good . __eou__  I'll see you later then . Have a great day ! __eou__
 Thanks a bunch . __eou__  Don't mention it . __eou__
 OK , I'd love the company . __eou__  This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it . __eou__
 I know the perfect place ! __eou__  Good ! Where is it ? __eou__
 That would be great . __eou__  Glad you asked me to join you . This will be fun ! __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  It's no problem at all . __eou__
 I really need to learn this stuff . __eou__  He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ? __eou__
 Yes , that sounds right for me . __eou__  Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ? __eou__
 Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing . __eou__  I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year ! __eou__
 Thanks , Professor . See you later ! __eou__  See you later ! Drive carefully . __eou__
 That sounds good . __eou__  Good , just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! __eou__
 That's great . Thank you so much . __eou__  Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! __eou__

 You mean you haven ’ t arranged any car ? __eou__  I ’ m sorry to say no . __eou__
 What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . __eou__  They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . __eou__
 Unbelievable ! Parking in this city is such a nightmare ! __eou__  Madam , patience is a virtue . __eou__
Oh , my god ! __eou__  What ! __eou__

 Wow ! It's big ! What could it be ? __eou__  I'll give you two clues . First , it cost more than $ 250 . And second , it's not big , but fat . __eou__
And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries ! __eou__  Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome ! __eou__
 Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome ! __eou__  And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage . __eou__
 And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage . __eou__  You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high . __eou__
 You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high . __eou__  I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music . __eou__

 Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . __eou__  Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__
 Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__  I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . __eou__

 I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . __eou__  Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__
 Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__  Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . __eou__  That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . __eou__
 Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! __eou__  Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . __eou__

 What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! __eou__  Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . __eou__
 What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? __eou__  Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . __eou__
 Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! __eou__  We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . __eou__

A funny thing happened to me the other day . __eou__  Oh , yes ? __eou__
 I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . __eou__  Mmm . __eou__
 Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him . __eou__  Really ? __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . __eou__

 Oh , yes , he is brilliant . What's the name of the young actor ? __eou__  Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . __eou__

 Yes , I like collecting antiques . __eou__  Why don't you get a new one ? __eou__
 Really , what makes you say that ? __eou__  Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? __eou__
 Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? __eou__  Three . Two boys and a girl . __eou__
I can ’ t believe it ! __eou__  What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . __eou__
 Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! __eou__  Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . __eou__  What were the odds ? __eou__

 Oh , it's unbelievable . She is such a chain smoker . __eou__  Yes , yes . She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby . __eou__
 That would be a definite bonus . __eou__  You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . __eou__
 How can we do that ? __eou__  You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? __eou__

 I like the old styles of dance . Such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . They're all graceful . __eou__  Why do you like old styles of dance ? __eou__

 Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? __eou__  You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two . __eou__

How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ? __eou__  I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday . __eou__
 How about Sunday , then ? We could start in the morning . __eou__  I might be able to do that . But I don't think I can do it well . __eou__
 Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most . __eou__  OK . I'll talk to you later . __eou__

 Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? __eou__  Yes , very good . __eou__
 Yes , very good . __eou__  What advantages does it have ? __eou__

 Okay . BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums . __eou__  Oh , that's great . I want to try later . __eou__
 Oh , that's great . I want to try later . __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . __eou__  A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? __eou__
 Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? __eou__  Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . __eou__
 Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . __eou__  Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . __eou__
 Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . __eou__  Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . __eou__
 Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . __eou__  Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . __eou__
 No way ! __eou__  Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . __eou__
 Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . __eou__  If Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . __eou__
 Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . __eou__  Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . __eou__
 Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . __eou__  Sure , that would be great . __eou__
 Sure , that would be great . __eou__  Ok , it's a date then ! __eou__
 Yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . __eou__  They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . __eou__
 Thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! __eou__  Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . __eou__
 How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! __eou__  If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . __eou__
 What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? __eou__  He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . __eou__
Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! __eou__  What's that ? __eou__
 How many planets are there in the solar system ? __eou__  That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nine . __eou__
 Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! __eou__  Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . __eou__
 I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . __eou__  That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__
 That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__  Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . __eou__
 Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . __eou__  I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . __eou__
 I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . __eou__  Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? __eou__
 I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth . __eou__  You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! __eou__
 You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! __eou__  Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . __eou__
Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? __eou__  I don't think so . __eou__
 How about going to a concert ? __eou__  That suits me fine . __eou__
 Really ? What happened ? __eou__  He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . __eou__
 You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . __eou__  You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . __eou__
 You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . __eou__  I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime . __eou__
 ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . __eou__  You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! __eou__
 I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . __eou__  But , you work with her everyday . __eou__
 That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . __eou__  You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? __eou__
 Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . __eou__  Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . __eou__
 You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . __eou__  Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? __eou__
 Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? __eou__  Yeah , I want the note . __eou__
 Yeah , I want the note . __eou__  Have a great time tomorrow night . __eou__
 Have a great time tomorrow night . __eou__  Thanks . I plan on it . __eou__
 Let me see . Uh-huh ... no , I guess I'll be free . __eou__  Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? __eou__
 Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? __eou__  Sounds like a good idea . __eou__
 Sounds like a good idea . __eou__  Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 . __eou__
 Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 . __eou__  Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom . __eou__
 Really ? Then just ask her to follow me . __eou__  I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ? __eou__
 To tell you the truth , I have never thought of being a swimmer . I swim just for fun . __eou__  That's good . __eou__
 Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? __eou__  That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . __eou__
 Sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ? __eou__  I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . __eou__
 Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . __eou__  What should I do then ? __eou__
 I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . __eou__  I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__  The same to you ! __eou__
 The same to you ! __eou__  Are you doing anything special ? __eou__
Have a nice weekend ! __eou__  Thanks.You too ! __eou__

 Really ? Are you OK ? __eou__  I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? __eou__
 That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__  I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? __eou__
Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . __eou__  Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . __eou__

 Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . __eou__  Wow ! __eou__

 That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . __eou__  Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__

 Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? __eou__  Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . __eou__
 Good Point ! __eou__  But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? __eou__
 Wonderful . __eou__  It ’ s 8357688 8 . __eou__
 Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__

 Great , is it a two bedroom house ? __eou__  No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . __eou__
 That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you . __eou__  Yeas , when will you buy a house ? __eou__

 That's great ! __eou__  Since last time we've climbed the mountain , we haven't gone out for a long time . __eou__
 Since last time we've climbed the mountain , we haven't gone out for a long time . __eou__  And this kind of weather is rare for the season either . __eou__
 And this kind of weather is rare for the season either . __eou__  Yes , I remember last year this time , the weather is so hot . __eou__

 Daniel loves the beach very much ! __eou__  He will enjoy himself this weekend . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep . __eou__
 What ? Beg your pardon . __eou__  John is in prison now . He was copped outstealing . __eou__
 Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much . __eou__  Yeah . But his relation with Sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife . __eou__

Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I'm looking forward to this party , but I didn't want to go alone . __eou__  Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__
 Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__  No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there . __eou__
 Thanks for telling me this . __eou__  I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__  Huh ? __eou__
 Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__  Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . __eou__
Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ? __eou__  Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches . __eou__
Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__  Why do you say that ? __eou__
 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__  Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__
 She is expecting . __eou__  Congratulations to you . __eou__
 Congratulations to you . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . __eou__  Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . __eou__
 Really ? Does Mary know that ? __eou__  Of course not . __eou__
 Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake . __eou__  You want to bet ? __eou__
An interesting meeting , isn't it ? __eou__  Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . __eou__
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . __eou__  Let me introduce myself , by the way . My name's Thomas Bradley . __eou__
 Glad to meet you . __eou__  And what do you do , Ted ? __eou__
 Oh , really ? What do you do there exactly ? __eou__  I'm in the Personnel Department . __eou__

 Does 6 thirty suit you ? __eou__  It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . __eou__
 It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . __eou__  Thanks , goodbye . __eou__
 Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . __eou__  You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . __eou__
 You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . __eou__  That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . __eou__
 That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . __eou__  Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . __eou__
That was a great party . Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up . __eou__  It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__
 It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__  I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__
 I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__  I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . __eou__
 And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam . __eou__  I wish he could too . __eou__
 It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . __eou__  It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . __eou__
Aren ’ t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world . __eou__  I just don ’ t find it very interesting . __eou__
 I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event . __eou__  I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries . __eou__
 I think the Olympics help to promote world peace . __eou__  I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other . __eou__
 Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics . __eou__  Now there we are in agreement ! __eou__
 Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus . __eou__  I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them ! __eou__
 That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . __eou__  The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . __eou__
 That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? __eou__  A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . __eou__
 I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? __eou__  What a good idea ! __eou__
 That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__  I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__
 I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__  I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__
 That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__  Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__
 Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . __eou__  Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . __eou__
Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . __eou__  Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? __eou__
 Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? __eou__  Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? __eou__
 Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? __eou__  Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . __eou__
 Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . __eou__  The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? __eou__
 The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? __eou__  Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . __eou__
 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . __eou__  When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . __eou__
 When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . __eou__  Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect . __eou__
 Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect . __eou__  Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . __eou__
 That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . __eou__  How do you research your books ? __eou__
 How do you research your books ? __eou__  I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people . __eou__

If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review . __eou__

 Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you ! __eou__  Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... __eou__

 You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? __eou__  You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film " . __eou__
 You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film " . __eou__  It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the “ best actor and actress ” . __eou__
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . __eou__  When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? __eou__
 That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . __eou__  That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit . __eou__
 Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . __eou__  I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . __eou__
 That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? __eou__  I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . __eou__

 That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? __eou__  No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . __eou__
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__  would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__
 I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__  I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__
 I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__  The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__
 The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__  Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__
I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! __eou__  Why not ! It ’ s a classic . In fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . __eou__
 I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . __eou__  So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? __eou__
 There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! __eou__  That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . __eou__
 Thank you very much for doing this interview . __eou__  My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__
 My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__  Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . __eou__
 It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it . __eou__  Can I read it when you ’ re done ? __eou__
 Can I read it when you ’ re done ? __eou__  Sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . __eou__
 Sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . __eou__  How many chapters does the book have ? __eou__
 I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then . __eou__  Thanks . Charlie ! __eou__
 Thanks . Charlie ! __eou__  No problem . Bob . __eou__
 That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? __eou__  Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . __eou__
 ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . __eou__  Of course not ! __eou__
 Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? __eou__  I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . __eou__
I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? __eou__  Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? __eou__
 Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? __eou__  I want to have a foot massage and haircut . __eou__

 Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures . __eou__  This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour ! __eou__
 This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour ! __eou__  I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? __eou__
 I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? __eou__  Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . __eou__
 Of course . What do you want to move first ? __eou__  Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . __eou__
 So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! __eou__  How do you want to spend your old age ? __eou__
 Oh , thanks a lot . __eou__  What time are you leaving ? __eou__
 Really ? Do you like it ? __eou__  Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? __eou__
 Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? __eou__  I ’ m a bus driver . __eou__

 You're kidding . __eou__  No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . __eou__
 Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . __eou__  Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . __eou__
 You must be joking . Those two ? __eou__  Well , my dear . I didn't believe either . But got it straight form the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  How can I go there to have a taste ? __eou__
 Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set . __eou__  Can I help you in anyway ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Bye . __eou__
 That ’ s a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job . __eou__  I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . __eou__
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__  Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__
 I think so . Blue is still very fashionable at the moment . __eou__  This style came out last year , though . I like the dress , but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year . __eou__
 That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? __eou__  Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . __eou__
 That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbours don ’ t mind too much . __eou__  Helen gets on very well with her neighbours . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . __eou__
 Helen gets on very well with her neighbours . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . __eou__  I ’ m ready looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast ! __eou__
 I ’ m ready looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast ! __eou__  Well , don ’ t be late . I ’ ll see you on Friday at Helen ’ s . __eou__
 You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . __eou__  Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . __eou__
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . __eou__  Me too . __eou__
Have you seen that house ? __eou__  Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__
 Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__  You're right . I love it very much . __eou__
 You're right . I love it very much . __eou__  It must be old . __eou__
My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! __eou__  No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . __eou__
 That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? __eou__  It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . __eou__
 Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
I'm going to try sky diving this weekend . __eou__  I wouldn't do it if I were you . __eou__
 It's sounds like fun . __eou__  It's very dangerous , you know . __eou__
 I want to try something exciting . __eou__  It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you . __eou__
 I'll tell you all about it next Monday . __eou__  Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . __eou__
 Really ? That's wonderful ! __eou__  Thank you for your warning . __eou__
 Thank you for your warning . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Thank you . I wish I would . __eou__  Good luck to you . __eou__
John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? __eou__  Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? __eou__

My friend Jane is very beautiful . __eou__  What's her figure ? __eou__
 Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too . __eou__  What's the color of her eyes ? __eou__
 I liked it . I thought it was great . __eou__  Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? __eou__
 Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? __eou__  Not really . I thought it was disappointing . __eou__
 It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? __eou__  Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . __eou__
I just love your hair that way . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  Where did you have it done ? __eou__
 Well , it looks very nice . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__

 I enjoy the various characters and the plot . __eou__  Well . I like the Thom Birds best . __eou__
 Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? __eou__  That's a good idea . Let's go ! __eou__
 Um , that ’ s good . __eou__  Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . __eou__
Jenny , are you having fun here ? __eou__  Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . __eou__

 Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . __eou__  Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__
Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . __eou__  How about taking a walk in the park ? __eou__
 How about taking a walk in the park ? __eou__  OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . __eou__

 And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . __eou__  Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ? __eou__

 So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun . __eou__  Yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ? __eou__

 Football ? Sounds dangerous . Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader . __eou__  C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV . __eou__
Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing . __eou__  It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . __eou__

 Really ? Are you sure ? __eou__  Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__
 Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia . __eou__  You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia . __eou__
 You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia . __eou__  I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad . __eou__
 Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak . __eou__  Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds . __eou__
 Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! __eou__  Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! __eou__
 What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? __eou__  Mumm . no . __eou__
 What ? __eou__  The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . __eou__
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . __eou__  It does seem like the perfect day !

Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels . __eou__

Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning ! __eou__

 Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? __eou__  Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . __eou__
 Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . __eou__  Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . __eou__
 Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . __eou__  The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! __eou__
 Uh-huh . __eou__  But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? __eou__
 Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . __eou__  Now that ’ s a great idea ! __eou__

 I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . __eou__  You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . __eou__
 You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! __eou__  Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . __eou__
It's almost midnight ! We are about to start a brand new year ! __eou__  I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . __eou__
 I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . __eou__  Do you have a New Year's resolution ? __eou__

 Ah thank you ! I'm very excited . We were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . It was wonderful . __eou__  That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money ! __eou__
 That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money ! __eou__  I know what you mean . I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive , don't you ? __eou__
 Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ? __eou__  My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... __eou__
 My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... __eou__  I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights . __eou__
 I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights . __eou__  Well , I really recommend Spain . You really should go . Anyway , it's been great to catch up , but I must be going , this is my floor . Speak again soon I hope . __eou__
 Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ? __eou__  I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? __eou__
 I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? __eou__  Yes , I'm leaving at four pm . __eou__

 Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! __eou__  Count me in ! __eou__
This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? __eou__  Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? __eou__
 Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! __eou__  Well , I have no regrets ! __eou__
 Well , I have no regrets ! __eou__  I ’ ll drink to that ! __eou__
 Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . __eou__  Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? __eou__
 What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? __eou__  That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! __eou__
 So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? __eou__  Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . __eou__
 I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__  Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__
 A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . __eou__  It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__
 Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . __eou__  It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__
 It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__  Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? __eou__
 Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? __eou__  Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? __eou__
 Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? __eou__  I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . __eou__
 Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? __eou__  Uh ... yeah .. of course ! __eou__
 Honey ... __eou__  Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... __eou__
 Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... __eou__  Baby , I love you so much . __eou__
 Baby , I love you so much . __eou__  You do ? __eou__
 You do ? __eou__  I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . __eou__

 Well , we were talking and catching up on what we ’ Ve been doing , talking about work and family , when all of a sudden , Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it ! He started freaking out , and screaming ... __eou__  Ha ha , really ? __eou__
 Ha ha , really ? __eou__  Yeah , and the funniest thing was , that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl . You had to be there ! Everyone was staring and laughing ... it was hilarious ! __eou__

I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! __eou__
 Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! __eou__  Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! __eou__
 Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! __eou__  Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . __eou__

 That would be great ! Give me a call ! __eou__  See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . __eou__
I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! __eou__  Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! __eou__
 Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! __eou__  Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ? __eou__
 He ’ s really good looking , he ’ s quite tall , around 6 ’ 1 ” , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... __eou__  He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ? __eou__
 He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ? __eou__  You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! __eou__
 You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! __eou__  Hold on a sec , his name is David ? __eou__
 What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref ! __eou__  Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws . __eou__
 That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah ! __eou__  Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! __eou__
 It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . __eou__  Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . __eou__
I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! __eou__  Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! __eou__
 Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! __eou__  Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? __eou__
 That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . Oh , they look so cute ! __eou__  I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . __eou__
 That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous . Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? __eou__  Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? __eou__
This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . __eou__  Yes . I like it very much . __eou__
 Yes . I like it very much . __eou__  Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . __eou__
 It's excellent . __eou__  Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . __eou__
 It's delicious . __eou__  What sort of western food do you like best ? __eou__
 I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . __eou__  Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . __eou__
Good morning , Mary ! __eou__  Good morning , John ! __eou__
 Good morning , John ! __eou__  I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? __eou__
 I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? __eou__  Yes , if that's all right for you . __eou__
 I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ? __eou__  Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__
 Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__  That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . __eou__
 No , thank you . __eou__  That's the most important thing . __eou__
 I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . __eou__  Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . __eou__
 Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . __eou__  Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in Shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . __eou__
 That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . __eou__  Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . __eou__
 Great ! That's settled then . __eou__  OK . __eou__
 Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ? __eou__  Around six pm . __eou__
 Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . __eou__  Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ? __eou__
 Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . __eou__  OK . Then I'll be expecting you . __eou__
 OK . Then I'll be expecting you . __eou__  I'll be there on time . __eou__
 Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__  Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__
 That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__  That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__
 Really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . __eou__  They did . He inherited the money from an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . __eou__
 Dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? __eou__  He said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . __eou__
 Really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? __eou__  No , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a bonus for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . __eou__
Hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ? __eou__  Hello ! I was exhausted some studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the police haven ’ t caught the killer yet . __eou__
 I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . __eou__  I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! __eou__
Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy . __eou__  Nice to meet you , I'am Seven . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before . __eou__
 Nice to meet you , I'am Seven . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before . __eou__  No , I just started working here at IBM , I am assigned sale department . __eou__
 Really ? I don't believe I would met him , is he here now ? __eou__  Yes , That's him over there-the taller , handsome one . Would you let me introduce you ? __eou__
 Nice to meet you . __eou__  May I know your name , please ? __eou__
 Good . __eou__  May I know what you do ? __eou__
 Sure . That would be great . Good luck . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you for your hospitality . __eou__  Thanks for coming . __eou__

 You ’ re welcome . __eou__  Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me . __eou__
 That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? __eou__  There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . __eou__
 Thank you very much . I had a really good time . __eou__  Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . __eou__
 Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . __eou__  That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . __eou__
 That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . __eou__  Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 . __eou__
 Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here . __eou__  It's been a long time ! What's new ? __eou__
 Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye ! __eou__  Yes , stay in touch . Bye ! __eou__
 Yesterday morning was beautiful I thought the sunning was going to continue . __eou__  So did I . that's why I didn't take my umbrella . I got cold in the rain in the afternoon . It was raining cats and dogs . __eou__
 I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . __eou__  Canada , China , and the USA are huge too . __eou__
 There are the pymeids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . __eou__  They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . __eou__
 I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? __eou__  I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . __eou__
 Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! __eou__  Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? __eou__
 that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? __eou__  I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 20 minutes to drive there . __eou__
 Wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . __eou__  We can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit . __eou__
 Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? __eou__  Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . __eou__
 Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? __eou__  Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes . So you'd better dress warmly before you go out . __eou__
 Really ? Can't you stay a little longer ? __eou__  No , I really must go now.My family are expecting me home soon . __eou__
Mary , today is a great day for you . __eou__  How nice of you to remember ! __eou__
 How nice of you to remember ! __eou__  Oh , here's a little token of my affection . __eou__
 Oh , here's a little token of my affection . __eou__  You're so thoughtful.Thank you . __eou__

 That's nice . __eou__  Join us , will you ? __eou__
 Don't you think these festivals are more interesting ! __eou__  What an idea ! __eou__
Another weekend is coming ! __eou__  And we're going to have summer vacation . __eou__
I'm feeling wonderful . __eou__  Are you crazy ? The papers make everybody listless . I don't think you are the exception __eou__
 Are you crazy ? The papers make everybody listless . I don't think you are the exception __eou__  I'm no exception , and that's why I spent a whole afternoon in the swimming pool . __eou__

 Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? __eou__  Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . __eou__
 It is such a nice place . __eou__  Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . __eou__
 Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . __eou__  Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . __eou__
 I hope so . Thank you again for your delightful gift . __eou__  Don't mention it . __eou__

 Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! __eou__  Thank you , shall I open it now ? __eou__
 Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . __eou__  Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__
 Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__  Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . __eou__
 I hope so . A good journey to you ! __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? __eou__  Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? __eou__
 That's a good idea.What ' s on ? __eou__  Gone with the Wind . __eou__
 Really ? Do you like the story ? It's sheer nonsense ! __eou__  It's exaggerated . Actually this sort of thing happens to everyone . __eou__
 Wow , you sound very professional . __eou__  I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . __eou__
 Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . __eou__  How did that happen ? __eou__
Titanic made a hit ! It was so touching . __eou__  But I see things rather differently.The heroin is not attractive and her acting is just so-so . __eou__
 You must be joking . The job is nice and she is well paid . __eou__  It's true , but she says she is tired of counting others ' money . __eou__
Good Lord ! Look at that man . __eou__  Yes ? __eou__
 Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__  You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? __eou__
 Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . __eou__  Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . __eou__
He's honest , hardworking and responsible . I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee . __eou__  I rather doubt it.You ' re cheated by his appearance , I think . __eou__
 Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . __eou__  Well , Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . __eou__
 It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . __eou__  Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . __eou__
 Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . __eou__  I guess we'll see just around . __eou__
 Really ? What's he been doing ? __eou__  You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . __eou__
 Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? __eou__  He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . __eou__
 France ? Is he crazy ? __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . __eou__  I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . __eou__
 I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . __eou__  Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . __eou__
 Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . __eou__  I will . See you later . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  Do you need a hand with that ? __eou__
 Actually , I could you some help . Thank you so much . __eou__  Don't worry about it . __eou__
 Yes , I am . You must be Tom . Nice to meet you . __eou__  Nice to meet you too . Let me help you with your bags . __eou__
 Nice to meet you too . Let me help you with your bags . __eou__  Be careful , Tom . Those are pretty heavy . __eou__
 No kidding ? __eou__  My brother won a free trip and he's taking me . __eou__
I love ice cream . __eou__  Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? __eou__
 Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? __eou__  I like both strawberry and coffee ice cream . __eou__
 Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil . __eou__  I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that . __eou__
 Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ? __eou__  Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ? __eou__
 Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas . __eou__  Great , so what happens now ? __eou__
 Great , so what happens now ? __eou__  Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . __eou__
 Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? __eou__  About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid . __eou__
 That ’ s really interesting , you have to play for me some time . __eou__  Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__
 Great ! I went hiking in the mountains on Saturday . __eou__  Fantastic ! how was that ? __eou__
 Fantastic ! how was that ? __eou__  Really good ! you should try it sometime . __eou__
 Really good ! you should try it sometime . __eou__  I might . what did you do yesterday ? __eou__
It seems a glorious day today . __eou__  I agree ... __eou__
 Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . __eou__  Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__
 Are you serious ? You haven't even been anywhere on vacation ? __eou__  No , I have never vacationed anywhere exotic . But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time , at least I can travel on company time ! __eou__
 Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast . __eou__  Have you been to California ? __eou__
 It's great ! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.Have you been here for a long time ? __eou__  About six years ... __eou__
 Wow , talk about job perks ! That's great . I would like to do something exciting like that.But I am only an accountant.Not too much excitement there.huh ? __eou__  That's okay.If it weren't for you accountants , nobody would have the money to go skiing ! __eou__
 Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... __eou__  It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ... __eou__
 Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . It's nice to see some improvement for a change . __eou__  Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ? __eou__
 It ’ s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much ! __eou__  I disagree . He was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . One should reward good service . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? __eou__  Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . __eou__
 Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . __eou__  Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . __eou__
 She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! __eou__  She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . __eou__
 Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . __eou__  Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . __eou__
Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone . __eou__  Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__
 Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__  No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one __eou__
 Thanks for telling me this . __eou__  I was late getting back from the mall , but I ’ m hurrying . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__  Huh ? __eou__
 Huh ? __eou__  I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? __eou__
 It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . __eou__  Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? __eou__
 Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? __eou__  Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it . __eou__
 Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__  Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish . __eou__
Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__  Why do you say that ? __eou__
 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__  Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__
 Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? __eou__  No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . __eou__
 Gambling ? Where ? __eou__  Las Vegas . I find gambling relaxing . I don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . Besides , I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . The casinos never close , you know . __eou__
 You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ? __eou__  Actually it will be my first time to meet her . __eou__
 Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast . __eou__  The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way . __eou__
 The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait ! __eou__  Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet . __eou__
 Let ’ s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! __eou__  You have such good ideas ! __eou__
 Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! __eou__  Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . __eou__
 Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . __eou__  Wow ! __eou__
 That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . __eou__  Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__
 Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . __eou__  Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__
 You saw a ghost ? When ? __eou__  It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... __eou__
 Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for two years ! How can he do that to you ? __eou__  I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn ’ t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her . __eou__
I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . __eou__  Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? __eou__
 Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? __eou__  All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . __eou__
 But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__  Why can't we ? __eou__
 Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all . __eou__  Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . __eou__
 Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! __eou__  Yeah , but that's what she did . __eou__
 I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . __eou__  Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . __eou__
 Huh ? Me ? __eou__  Yeah , you . I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there . __eou__
 I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly . __eou__  This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here . __eou__
 This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here . __eou__  Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors . __eou__
 That ’ s a great employment benefit ! __eou__  Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! __eou__
 Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . __eou__  Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! Mary ! __eou__  Merry Christmas ! Mr Bean . __eou__
 Merry Christmas ! Mr Bean . __eou__  Will you come to join us at dinner this evening ? My family will be happy to see you . And father misses you very much . __eou__
 Will you come to join us at dinner this evening ? My family will be happy to see you . And father misses you very much . __eou__  Well , I would be glad to , but I have promised Tom to see his Christmas tree , and play the piano for his song tonight . __eou__
 How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it . __eou__  OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . __eou__
 Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine . __eou__  You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? __eou__
 I like it , too . But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music . __eou__  You have good taste in music . __eou__
 Very good , What's on ? __eou__  I'm not sure . Let me give a call to find out . __eou__
I like this kind of weather . __eou__  Yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon . __eou__
 Yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon . __eou__  And it's calm . I like the peace . __eou__
 And it's calm . I like the peace . __eou__  Me , too . __eou__
 You're right.The air is so warm and everything looks so fresh and green . __eou__  Say , how about a walk along the river ? __eou__
 Say , how about a walk along the river ? __eou__  Marvelous idea ? __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__  Yes , the autumn is marvelous here . __eou__
 Yes , the autumn is marvelous here . __eou__  Tomorrow will be fine too , I think . __eou__
What lovely weather ! __eou__  It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having . __eou__
 It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having . __eou__  Let's go out and enjoy the fresh air . __eou__
 it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__  oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__
 oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__  he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__
 he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__  sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__
Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town . __eou__  Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight . __eou__
 Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight . __eou__  Let's go to the new club on West Street . __eou__
 Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again ! __eou__  We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! __eou__
 We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! __eou__  not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . __eou__
 not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . __eou__  The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . __eou__
 Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good . __eou__  Let's hope it is ! __eou__
 Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing . __eou__  I'm sure you'll have a good time . __eou__
Great ! I landed on Classic Movies . __eou__  I didn't know you liked old movies . __eou__
 Whew ! I'm impressed ! You really know your stuff ! __eou__  Only about old movies , really ... __eou__
 Pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . __eou__  If you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__
 You're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__  That's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__
 That's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__  When you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__
 Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . __eou__  No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! __eou__
 Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! __eou__  I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ? __eou__
 Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . __eou__  Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . __eou__
You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it ! __eou__  I almost did ! Actually , I don't know that much about coffee , even though I sell it . __eou__
 I almost did ! Actually , I don't know that much about coffee , even though I sell it . __eou__  I could give you a few pointers if you want . I know a lot about coffee . __eou__
My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ? __eou__  Actually , I was watching your auction all along . I saw you drop out at $ 250 . __eou__
Who got ripped off ? __eou__  Big time ! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . You really think it's completely safe ? __eou__
 Yep ! And take it with me anywhere ! And the music is free ! __eou__  Let me see it ! It's so small ! __eou__
 What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken ! __eou__  Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids . __eou__
I can't even imagine you snorkeling ! __eou__  Well , you'll see . With this new watch , I can go anywhere , do anything . __eou__
Hey , check out this new game I bought today . __eou__  Wow ! It's a trivia game all about the Academy Awards . __eou__
 Wow ! It's a trivia game all about the Academy Awards . __eou__  I know you love the Oscars . This game has some great questions about all types of movies . __eou__

 Thank you , shall I open it now ? __eou__  Yes , please do . __eou__
 Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . __eou__  Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__
 Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__  Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . __eou__
 Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . __eou__  Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . __eou__
 Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . __eou__  Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . __eou__
 That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ? __eou__  To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . __eou__
 To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . __eou__  It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now . __eou__
 No , really ? __eou__  Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__
 Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . __eou__  Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? __eou__
 Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? __eou__  Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . __eou__
 Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ? __eou__  It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance . __eou__
 You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . __eou__  That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__
 That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__  It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? __eou__
I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . __eou__  It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . __eou__
 It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . __eou__  I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . __eou__

 Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . __eou__  I will do my best . __eou__
 I ’ ll do my best . __eou__  That ’ s the way to go . __eou__
 Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . __eou__  There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . __eou__
I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . __eou__  That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? __eou__
 That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? __eou__  Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? __eou__
Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! __eou__  It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . __eou__
 It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . __eou__  You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! __eou__
 Certainly . The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . It must be very delicious . __eou__  Definitely . I really like Italian food . __eou__
 Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . __eou__  It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . __eou__
 I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . __eou__  It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . __eou__
 It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . __eou__  Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . __eou__
 Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__  You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? __eou__
 Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . __eou__  Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . __eou__
 Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? __eou__  It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . __eou__
 You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . __eou__  But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__
 Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! __eou__  Cool ! __eou__
 Cool ! __eou__  I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... __eou__
 The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? __eou__  First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . __eou__
 Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? __eou__  From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . __eou__
 Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . __eou__  Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . __eou__
Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . __eou__  That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it . __eou__
 That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it . __eou__  Thanks . Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ? __eou__
 No problem . See you ! __eou__  See you ! __eou__
 Really ? Are you sure ? __eou__  Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__
 Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you . __eou__  Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . __eou__
 Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . __eou__
 You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . __eou__  Me too . Have a great day . __eou__
 Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided . __eou__  Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting . __eou__
 Oh , but I suppose he has lots of talents . __eou__  He is a bootlicker . I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake . __eou__
 Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? __eou__  To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . __eou__
 Haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . I hate making cold calls ... __eou__  Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain . __eou__
 Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... They're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.It must be a rumor.It can't be true . __eou__  I read it myself on the financial page.They ' re really going to join together . U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month . __eou__
 What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? __eou__  Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . __eou__
 Thank you very much . We really had a good time . __eou__  Well . Thank you for coming . __eou__
 Well . Thank you for coming . __eou__  So see you . __eou__
 You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . __eou__  Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl . __eou__
 Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
 My pleasure . __eou__  I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? __eou__
 You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . __eou__  Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . __eou__
 Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? __eou__  Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you . __eou__
 Say hi to your family for me . __eou__  Thanks , I will , byebye ! __eou__

 Take care , and give my best to your parents . __eou__  Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . __eou__
 But why ? Since you like it so much . __eou__  Because bicycles are safer . __eou__
Thank you for coming to see me off . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Not at all . __eou__  If I have time , I will come again . __eou__

 Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . __eou__  Glad to hear that . __eou__
 So I think I may fall in love with her . __eou__  You are attracted to her . That sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love ? __eou__

 Yes . To be frank , I really love him to death . __eou__  You are so lucky . __eou__
 Why ? Are you kidding me ? A guy like that is hard to find . Few boys are so caring , so patient , and did I mention he is hottie ? __eou__  You really think so ? __eou__
 Totally . I am saying it from the bottom of my heart ! And it's obvious that he ’ s head over heels in love with you , too . __eou__  I sure hope so . __eou__
 Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again ! __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? __eou__  You ’ Ve put it among these journals . __eou__

 Well . We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia . __eou__  Wow , isn't that dangerous ? __eou__
 A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__  Tell me about it . __eou__
 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__  Yeah , It was scary but exhilarating . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting . __eou__  Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it . __eou__
 Yeah , I will . See you then ! __eou__  Ok , see you . __eou__

It's a perfect day for swimming . __eou__  I am going to the beech . How about coming with me ? __eou__
 Great ! I love swimming . Besides , I need a tan for Hill ’ s party .. __eou__  Don't forget the sun block lotion . You don't want a sunburn , do you ? __eou__
 Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? __eou__  You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? __eou__
 We went to the coast . It's really a nice place for camping , really good time around the fire singing and dancing . __eou__  How many members were in your party in all ? __eou__
 Really ? Me too . __eou__  Which one do you like best ? __eou__
Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . __eou__  Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . __eou__
 Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 . __eou__  I hope it's not gonna break into three digits __eou__
 Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? __eou__  It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . __eou__
Wow ! You look like a drowned rat ! Didn't you know there is a thunder-storm today ? __eou__  I knew there would be a shower , but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today . __eou__
Good morning , Jim ! __eou__  Good morning , Emma ! A lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__

 Don't you have a garage ? __eou__  Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . __eou__
 The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports . __eou__  That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . __eou__
 Are you kidding She is behind the times . That style went out last year . __eou__  Oh , come on , as long as it looks good on her . __eou__
Look how fast that car can accelerate ! __eou__  I've never seen anything like it . __eou__
 It ’ s pretty good . __eou__  Well I don ’ t think so . I don ’ t like it at all ! __eou__
 Let ’ s dine out tonight for a change ! __eou__  Good idea ! __eou__
 Lizzy who ? __eou__  Lizzy smith . __eou__
 That sounds terrific . __eou__  Why do you ask me these questions ? __eou__
 It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ? __eou__  Have a try . __eou__
Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . __eou__  You do ? __eou__
 You do ? __eou__  Yeah , those classics from the great writers . __eou__
 Yeah , those classics from the great writers . __eou__  But I find Japanese ones better . __eou__
 Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . __eou__  That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . __eou__
You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . __eou__  So you are . __eou__
 And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . __eou__  I feel exactly the same way with you . __eou__
 It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods . __eou__  Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels . __eou__
 It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? __eou__  Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . __eou__
You look so tan and healthy ! __eou__  Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . __eou__
 Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . __eou__  How was it ? __eou__
 Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . __eou__  Like what ? __eou__
 Hi Kate ... thanks ... wow ! Look at all the furniture . You must spent a fortune on it ! I love your new three-pieces suite . __eou__  I told you that I had been saving up money to buy some new furniture and do some redecorating . I finally saved enough and did everything at once . __eou__
 Good for you ! You ’ Ve got new curtains too . That ’ s a very nice shade of blue . This sofa is very comfortable . I could sit on it all day ! __eou__  Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think . __eou__
 Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think . __eou__  To be honest , it looks like your old carpet . Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ? __eou__
Guess what ! __eou__  What ? __eou__
 Why not ? __eou__  His father is a prisoner . __eou__
 Why , that's very kind of you , Mrs . Johnson . I'm sure my wife will be glad to . __eou__  How about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__
 Really ? Why not ? I hear it ’ s pretty good . __eou__  The people don ’ t really work out there . They just stand around and talk all the time . __eou__
 Sounds nice . What about classes ? __eou__  The usual . Aerobics , kickboxing , yoga . They just started a Tai Chi class too . __eou__
 Wow , that sounds great . __eou__  Well , I have a guest pass . Why don ’ t you come with me tonight ? __eou__
 Perfect . See you later . __eou__  O . K . , see you . __eou__
 Oh , yeah ? Which team ? __eou__  The Rockets . __eou__

 Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ? __eou__  That's what I'm wondering , too . __eou__
 Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Please give my best regards to them when you're home . __eou__  Sure , thank you . __eou__
 Really ? Maybe I should work for you . __eou__  Welcome . I could use the help . __eou__
 Only four days ! That's so short , and you seem so crazy about her . __eou__  I know . I can't help thinking about her . She's always on my mind . __eou__
I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . __eou__  Yes . It's perfect . __eou__
 Yes . It's perfect . __eou__  And all of the flowers are in bloom . __eou__
Why you are so crazy about Beijing Opera ? It's so boring . __eou__  But I think it's fantastic and charming . Well , you have your opinion and I have mine . __eou__
 But I think it's fantastic and charming . Well , you have your opinion and I have mine . __eou__  Maybe you're right . But I just still can't understand ... __eou__
 You have a fantastic view . __eou__  Yes . I love living here . __eou__
 Yes . I love living here . __eou__  Look ! You can see the village way down in the valley . __eou__
 Look ! You can see the village way down in the valley . __eou__  Yes . It ’ s a lovely view . __eou__
 Is she ? I thought she was a mathematician . __eou__  I ’ m so thirsty . __eou__
 Are you ? I thought you had something to drink at her home . __eou__  No . Edith didn ’ t give anything to drink . __eou__
Everybody , I'd like to propose a toast to Mary Johnson , Teacher of the Year . She worked hard all year . She really deserved the honor . __eou__  Yes , we're all proud of her ! __eou__
 Yes , we're all proud of her ! __eou__  Here's to you , Mary ! __eou__
 Here's to you , Mary ! __eou__  Cheers ! __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  You bet . You should try it yourself . __eou__
I couldn't wait to meet you in person . __eou__  Me , too . I've heard so much about you . __eou__
 Me , too . I've heard so much about you . __eou__  Same here . __eou__
 Same here . __eou__  I was looking forward to your arrival . __eou__
 Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great . __eou__  Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed . __eou__
 Why is that ? It is called real art . __eou__  Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . __eou__
 Shadow-boxing ? How interesting ! Do you think it really helpful for your health ? __eou__  Definitely . It not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul . __eou__
Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S . __eou__  Yes . I'm leaving tomorrow . I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you . __eou__
 You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you . __eou__  I'll miss you too , my friends . __eou__
 Why ? You were a real movie buff when you were a student . __eou__  But now I would stay at home watching TV . __eou__
 That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ? __eou__  Right now I ’ m basically just a secretary , but if I ’ m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there . __eou__
 Good idea . __eou__  Since we ’ re good friends , you don't have to pay me . __eou__
Is there something wrong ? You look so sad . __eou__  My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . __eou__
Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . __eou__  I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . __eou__
 I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . __eou__  Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . __eou__
 Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . __eou__  I will . See you later . __eou__

 He did ? That's too bad ! __eou__  I think so , too . __eou__
 What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ? __eou__  It was entertaining in some ways . But in general I didn't like it . __eou__
Hey , David . Where did you get the sofa ? It's so beautiful . Look at the color , I really love this yellow , so bright ! It must be very expensive . __eou__  Not really . To be honest , it's very cheap . I only spent $ 100 . __eou__
 Are you kidding ? $ 100 for this big leather sofa ? __eou__  Yes . I bought it in Johnson thrift store . __eou__
 Right . Since my work is near a park , it ’ s a really nice ride , too . __eou__  How far is it ? __eou__
 Thanks . I finally got rid of that old Nissan that got me through college . __eou__  What is this , the new Ford ? __eou__
I ’ m glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . __eou__  I trust you ’ re keeping well ? __eou__
Susan ? What brings you here today ? __eou__  Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . __eou__

Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! __eou__  Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? __eou__
 Can ’ t be better ! Bob , aren ’ t you glad the semester is over ? __eou__  Yep ! Are you going to the rock concert Friday night ? __eou__
 Sounds like fun . __eou__  You ’ ll have to buy your own ticket though . __eou__
Man , that sunset is beautiful . I ’ Ve never seen one so red . __eou__  Yeah , it ’ s pretty nice , but its so red because of air pollution . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yeah , the smog from all these cars gets into the air and turns the sunlight red . __eou__
Well , what a nice day ! __eou__  Yeah , the air is really fresh . __eou__
 Thanks for reminding me . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! __eou__  Well , you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this . __eou__
 Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . __eou__  So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . __eou__
 So nice to meet you , David . Call me Bill . It's very nice of you to come here . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
 I'm fine . After ten years , you still look great ! __eou__  So do you ! How are you doing ? __eou__
 So do you ! How are you doing ? __eou__  Not bad . Let's find a table and sit down . We have a lot to talk about . __eou__
 Oh , that's very nice of you . I don't want to sound pushy , but I still l have one more question . __eou__  Go ahead . __eou__
 That's interesting . Go on ! __eou__  My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . __eou__
 Yes ! Let ’ s go sailing and water skiing . That ’ s so exciting . __eou__  It ’ s expensive , too . Let ’ s just sit in the sun and go swimming instead . __eou__
 That's wonderful . Congratulations . __eou__  Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding . __eou__

 Very good ! I'm looking forward to it . Please give my best regards to John . And I wish you best luck ! __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now . __eou__  You look a bit familiar to me . I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before . __eou__
 It ’ s a small world ! May I know your name , miss ? __eou__  I ’ m Chen Ming . __eou__
 I ’ m glad to meet you , Mr . Song . __eou__  Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ? __eou__
 Oh , very interesting . And what about Rita ? She was such a bright child — always reading . __eou__  She ’ s a librarian at the public library . __eou__
 Really ? And Chris ? She was a very pretty little girl . __eou__  Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris . She ’ s married to a French photographer . __eou__
 Oh , how interesting . And what about Larry and Rocky ? __eou__  Larry drives a truck . He drives all over the country . We hardly ever seen him . __eou__
 Really ? Where does he live now ? __eou__  Colorado . __eou__
 Really ? Where does he fly ? Does he fly to other countries ? __eou__  Yes . Mostly to England and France . __eou__
 That ’ s great . Is the electrician here today ? __eou__  See , I just told you he hit a deer . Man , I knew you weren ’ t listening to me . __eou__
 Nothing ? __eou__  Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart , I think that ’ s how it goes , something like that . __eou__
Are these your triplets ? They ’ re beautiful ! I ’ Ve seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age . You know , they ’ re absolutely identical of you and John ! Are you planning on having any more ? __eou__  Bite your tongue ! I ’ m already at the end of my rope . Some nights I don ’ t sleep at all . John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs . __eou__
 That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ? __eou__  Sure . We ’ ll be looking forward to that day . __eou__
 Sure . We ’ ll be looking forward to that day . __eou__  So will I . Thank you . __eou__
Thank you for your letter . __eou__  Is your waist any better ? __eou__
 Yes , I ’ m feeling very well these days . __eou__  I ’ m glad you are getting better . __eou__
 I ’ m glad you are getting better . __eou__  And I was glad to receive your letter . __eou__
 And I was glad to receive your letter . __eou__  Then when will you be back again ? __eou__
Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . __eou__  It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . __eou__
 It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . __eou__  Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! __eou__
 Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! __eou__  Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! __eou__
 Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! __eou__  A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! __eou__
 A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! __eou__  The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! __eou__
 The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! __eou__  Great play ! __eou__
 Great play ! __eou__  We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! __eou__
 We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! __eou__  Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! __eou__
 That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? __eou__  Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . __eou__
 Sounds nice . __eou__  Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies . __eou__
 I'm glad you feel that way.We ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ? __eou__  Fine . __eou__
 Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . __eou__  So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . __eou__
Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! __eou__  Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . __eou__
 What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? __eou__  Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . __eou__
 What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? __eou__  That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for ! __eou__
That was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook . __eou__  I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ? __eou__
 I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ? __eou__  I don't know . I'm pretty full . What are we having ? __eou__
 Ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice . __eou__  Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? __eou__
 Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? __eou__  I'll have a cup of tea . __eou__
 That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__  Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . __eou__
 Good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__  If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__
 It's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . __eou__  What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__
 That sounds like fun . __eou__  Hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! __eou__
 Hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! __eou__  English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought . __eou__
 Say hello to your friends for me . __eou__  Likewise . See you later . __eou__
 Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . __eou__  I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . __eou__
 that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? __eou__  no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? __eou__
 Thank you very much for doing this interview . __eou__  My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__
 My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__  Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . __eou__
 I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__  do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__
 I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__  to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
 I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! __eou__  Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . __eou__
 Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . __eou__  Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? __eou__
 Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? __eou__  There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your __eou__
 There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your __eou__  Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . __eou__
 Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . __eou__  I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . __eou__
 That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? __eou__  I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . __eou__
 Of course ! I bought two copies . __eou__  Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ? __eou__
Guess what ? I've got great news ! __eou__  What is it ? __eou__
 Really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ? __eou__  She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back . __eou__
 Wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ? __eou__  It's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . __eou__
 Yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! __eou__  Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ? __eou__
 I'm really looking forward to reading your column . __eou__  Me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? __eou__
 Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . __eou__  I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . __eou__
 Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . __eou__  I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . __eou__
 I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . __eou__  I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! __eou__
London is such a historic city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of __eou__  I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historic figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . __eou__
 I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . __eou__  I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . __eou__
 That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? __eou__  Let ’ s meet at 12:30 . it will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits . __eou__
 Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? __eou__  I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . __eou__
 That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? __eou__  I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . __eou__
 I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention ! __eou__  To each their own ! __eou__
 That sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? __eou__  It's on at 8 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . __eou__
 Great . Shall I meet you there around 7 forty-five tomorrow night ? __eou__  Sounds good . I'll see you then ! __eou__
 Sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well . __eou__  You're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink . __eou__
 This is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ? __eou__  Just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ? __eou__
 One glass of red wine coming up ! __eou__  So how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ? __eou__
 Oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ? __eou__  Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well . __eou__
 Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot . __eou__  Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . __eou__
 Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . __eou__  This is gonna be a great barbecue ! __eou__
 Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you __eou__  Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! __eou__
 Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! __eou__  Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be __eou__
 Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! __eou__  The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? __eou__
Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! __eou__  I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! __eou__
 I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! __eou__  Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... __eou__
 Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . __eou__  Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? __eou__
 What ? Why do we have to do that ? __eou__  Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . __eou__
 I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__  What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? __eou__
 Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__  That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__
 The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa __eou__  I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . __eou__
 I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . __eou__  This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g __eou__
 Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec __eou__  All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__
 You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . __eou__  So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? __eou__
 Yes , it's beautiful weather we're having . __eou__  We can't complain about the weather recently . __eou__
 I'm fine , thanks . And you ? __eou__  Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? __eou__
 Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? __eou__  Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? __eou__
 Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . __eou__  What have you been doing ? __eou__
 Really ? Good luck for them . __eou__  Thanks . And how are your parents ? __eou__
 Thanks . And how are your parents ? __eou__  They're both very well , thanks . __eou__
 They're both very well , thanks . __eou__  Where are you going now ? __eou__
 It's been nice talking to you . __eou__  Good-bye . See you again sometime . __eou__
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A __eou__  It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca __eou__
 It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca __eou__  There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__
 There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__  Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes __eou__
Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started ! __eou__  Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents ! __eou__
 Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents ! __eou__  Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you ! __eou__
 Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you ! __eou__  This next one is from Betty . __eou__
 This next one is from Betty . __eou__  A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it ! __eou__
 A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it ! __eou__  One more from Carla . __eou__
 One more from Carla . __eou__  A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed ! __eou__
 A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed ! __eou__  OK , that ’ s all of them.No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? __eou__
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? __eou__  My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . __eou__
 I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . __eou__  I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . __eou__
 Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__  I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__
 Days ? __eou__  Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . __eou__
 Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . __eou__  Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . __eou__
 Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! __eou__  Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . __eou__
 Really ? In New Berlin ? __eou__  No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a " tornado watch . " That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . __eou__
 Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__  Aw , come on , it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__
 Aw , come on , it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__  No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__
 And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__  Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__
 Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__  Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . __eou__
 What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? __eou__  The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot __eou__
 Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! __eou__  It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... __eou__
 Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . __eou__  Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? __eou__
 Well , I have no regrets ! __eou__  I ’ ll drink to that ! __eou__
 What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? __eou__  It ’ s called Counter Strike.It ’ s a first person shooter game.It ’ s awesome.It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . __eou__
 You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! __eou__  My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . __eou__
You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! __eou__  Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! __eou__
 Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__  Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__
Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! __eou__  What is that ? __eou__
 A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! __eou__  Cool ! __eou__
 Cool ! __eou__  Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . __eou__
 Come on . Put the gun down . __eou__  Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . __eou__
 Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! __eou__  Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . __eou__
 How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . __eou__  You have always been so soft , Dave ! __eou__
 Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . __eou__  It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__
 Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? __eou__  Uh ... yeah .. of course ! __eou__
 Are you serious ? We ’ Ve been friends for years ! We can ’ t just change that overnight ! __eou__  I know ! I never had the guts to tell you ... until today . So , what do you say ? Are you willing to give me a shot ? __eou__
 Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ? __eou__  Yes , it is . __eou__
 But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail . __eou__  Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes . But what are you worried about ? __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes . __eou__
 I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company . __eou__  I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs . __eou__
 Good . Thank you for telling me this . __eou__  Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative . __eou__
 Really ! You live in Taiwan ! __eou__  Yes . Why not ? __eou__
 Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . __eou__  You seem excited about it . __eou__
 Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . __eou__  Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there . __eou__
 You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? __eou__  Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... __eou__
Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! __eou__  What are you so excited about ? __eou__
 I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__  What ’ s the big deal ? It ’ s just a picture of some woman . __eou__
 I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person . __eou__  There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . __eou__
 Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! __eou__  All right ! __eou__
 We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . __eou__  Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . __eou__
 Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . __eou__  Yeah , I will . See you then ! __eou__

 Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . __eou__  Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? __eou__
 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__  Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . __eou__
 Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores . __eou__  What an amazing goal ! __eou__
I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . __eou__  You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining . __eou__
 What do you mean ? It's expensive ! __eou__  Yes , but you have to calculate a little.You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.So you only spent one dollar per fall . That's cheap . __eou__
 Oh , I see him now . Wait ! That's ... __eou__  Yes , it's Mel Gibson . __eou__
 Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ? __eou__  I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ? __eou__
 500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ? __eou__  I don't want people to think I'm stingy . __eou__
 Huh ? You are breaking our rule already ! And we didn't even start to play yet ! __eou__  Oh , don't be so strict ! We are in Las Vegas . __eou__
I ’ m so excited about Chinese New Year ! When do I get to visit Grandma ? Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world ! __eou__  Ha ha , right . Sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma . __eou__
 Ha ha , right . Sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma . __eou__  Of course I miss Grandma , too . I bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play Mahjong ! Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them ! __eou__
 Of course I miss Grandma , too . I bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play Mahjong ! Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them ! __eou__  Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous ! __eou__
 What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref ! __eou__  Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws . __eou__
 Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time . __eou__  Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ... __eou__
 Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ... __eou__  What is it ? __eou__
 But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! __eou__  Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . __eou__
I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! __eou__  Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! __eou__
 Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! __eou__  Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? __eou__
 That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute ! __eou__  I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . __eou__
Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now . __eou__  The bigger they are , the harder they fall . __eou__
 Really ? Who did you hear that from ? __eou__  Just word of mouth . __eou__
I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me . __eou__  Great minds think alike . __eou__
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__  Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__
 The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__  Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__
 It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . __eou__  It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . __eou__
 absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself . __eou__  sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ? __eou__

 even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . __eou__  thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . __eou__
 really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? __eou__  no , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . __eou__
 are you serious ? __eou__  yes , I mean it . __eou__
 but why ? Did I do anything wrong ? __eou__  no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . __eou__
 well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . __eou__  I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? __eou__
 I went sky-diving ! __eou__  you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! __eou__
 you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! __eou__  It was scary , but it felt great , too . __eou__

 no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . __eou__  Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us . __eou__
What a nice day ! __eou__  yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? __eou__
 great , let's go ! __eou__  hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . __eou__
 hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . __eou__  exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__
 exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__  yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! __eou__
 are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? __eou__  never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? __eou__
 ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . __eou__  wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . __eou__
 really ? What do the companies do that for ? __eou__  I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__
 thanks a lot . __eou__  you ’ re welcome . __eou__
 great ! Thank you ! __eou__  my pleasure , and have a good time ! __eou__
 good luck ! __eou__  thanks ! __eou__

 that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . __eou__  you'll have to try for yourself some day . __eou__
 you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? __eou__  just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . __eou__
 congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! __eou__  shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? __eou__
 ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! __eou__  it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off . __eou__
You wouldn't believe what I got in the mail today ! __eou__  what's that ? __eou__
 it's a letter from Ray and Sue in Shanghai ! __eou__  have you read it yet ? __eou__
 ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... " Ray and I look forward to seeing you in June . Write soon . With love , Sue . " __eou__  are we going to see them in June or are they coming to see us ? __eou__
 pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . __eou__  if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__
 you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__  that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__
 that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__  when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__
 that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it . __eou__  you are welcome . Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling . __eou__
 you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! __eou__  What did you do after high school ? __eou__
I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend . __eou__  oh . __eou__
 that's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? __eou__  that's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . __eou__
 Wow , what a great burd ! __eou__  She sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__
 oh , why ? __eou__  I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them . __eou__
 that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . __eou__  true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything . __eou__
 well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . __eou__  yeah it is . __eou__
 you are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__  thank you . __eou__
this party rocks ! __eou__  you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! __eou__
 okay , here I go ! __eou__  good luck ! __eou__
 really ? What do you usually do online ? __eou__  well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly I chat online . You could say I'm addicted to online chatting . __eou__
 really ? What is it ? __eou__  I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? __eou__
 I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ? __eou__  I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c __eou__

 oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? __eou__  actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? __eou__
 really ? I haven't heard of it . __eou__  well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it . __eou__
 really ? Where did you hear that ? __eou__  I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__
 you're dancing so well . __eou__  you dance beautifully too . __eou__
 you dance beautifully too . __eou__  when did you learn to dance ? __eou__
 my pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__  ok . __eou__
 seriously ? But you are such a genius . __eou__  maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__
 there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . __eou__  well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . __eou__
what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! __eou__  that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . __eou__

you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander . __eou__  thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight . __eou__
 a guy I met on the internet three month ago . __eou__  really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ? __eou__
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__  yes , I am the guy . __eou__
 thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . __eou__  that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? __eou__
 that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? __eou__  how about at 6 pm ? __eou__
 really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__  do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__
 What did you say ? How many ? __eou__  15 people . __eou__
 800 books ? I'm impressed ! __eou__  My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That ' s what they learn here in America . __eou__
 See you on Moday.Have a great weekend . __eou__  You too.Thanks for dropping in . __eou__

 Take good care of yourself , Mary . __eou__  I will . Good-bye . __eou__
not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! __eou__  can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . __eou__
 Thanks for the sweet words . __eou__  Any time . __eou__
 Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . __eou__  When's he coming ? __eou__
 Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? __eou__  No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . __eou__
 We do many things . In the morning , we go swimming and boating . In the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . We sit around a camp fire at night.We sing or tell stories . __eou__  That sounds wonderful . __eou__
 That sounds wonderful . __eou__  It is wonderful . What's John going to do this summer ? __eou__
 the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? __eou__  yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... __eou__
 All right.Gotta go , bye , keep in touch . __eou__  Have a great day , take care , bye . __eou__
 Really ? What's the series about ? __eou__  well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . __eou__
 really ? that's interesting ! __eou__  yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . __eou__
I heard you received a prize for you book . __eou__  yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . __eou__
 yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . __eou__  congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . __eou__
 congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . __eou__  actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . __eou__
 actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . __eou__  what was the prize ? __eou__
 I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . __eou__  I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! __eou__
 really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . __eou__  they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . __eou__
 really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? __eou__  no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . __eou__
 Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? __eou__  The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . __eou__
 Really ? How much does it cost to fly to Rome ? __eou__  I don't know exactly , but it costs a lot of money . __eou__
Wake up sleepyhead.The sun is beginning to shine . What a lovely summer day ! __eou__  Yeah , clearly blue sky.But it is a bit too hot for me . I don't like heat and humidity . __eou__
 It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming ! __eou__  That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . __eou__
 Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini . __eou__  There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are . __eou__
I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows . __eou__  I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life . __eou__
 I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__  do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__
Why don ’ t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends . __eou__  He is the guy I was telling you about . __eou__
 Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old ! __eou__  She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty . __eou__
 I like the colour very much . It's a lovely dress , but it's too small for me . __eou__  What about this one ? It's a lovely dress . It's very smart . Short skirts are in fashion now . Would you like to try it ? __eou__
 What ? You've got to be kidding me ! __eou__  I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . __eou__
I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ? __eou__  Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . __eou__
 Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? __eou__  We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Hey ! __eou__
 Actually , I was hoping to mix business with pleasure . Would you be interested in joining me for dinner some time this week ? I thought we might try out the new Italian restaurant everyone ’ s been __eou__  Sure , Mike , I ’ d love to . __eou__
 Sure , Mike , I ’ d love to . __eou__  Is this evening too soon ? __eou__
Daniel , you know ? Lisa has invited us to have dinner this afternoon . __eou__  Really ? Let ’ s hit the road . __eou__
Honey . The cottages harmonize well with the landscape.That tourist resort is worth travelling to . __eou__  I ’ m so sorry that I have got to go . I have a business appointment right now . __eou__
Thank you . You do me a big favor . __eou__  That was a cake walk.It ’ s nothing to speak of . __eou__
Look ! It fits you perfectly . It looks great on you and has your name on it . __eou__  Really ? What about your opinion , Daniel ? __eou__
I ’ m so surprised to meet you in this remote village . Long time no see . __eou__  Yeah . How are you these days ? __eou__
How time flies ! We have been lovers for nearly a year . We hit it off instantly . __eou__  Yes , but do you think there is eternal love in the world ? __eou__
 No way ! __eou__  Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . __eou__
 Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating ! __eou__  No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office . __eou__
 Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race . __eou__  Really ? I think you ’ ll love it . __eou__
 Really ? I think you ’ ll love it . __eou__  As long as I don ’ t have to row . __eou__
Wow ! What ’ s the hold up ? __eou__  It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . __eou__
 Really ? That ’ s so cool . __eou__  I ’ m really lucky to do something I really love . __eou__
 I ’ m really lucky to do something I really love . __eou__  What station do you work at ? __eou__
 Really ? Why is that ? __eou__  Till I moved out of my parents ’ home , I became a lot more independent . __eou__
 I think so , hopefully we ’ ll have a long and a happy life together . __eou__  I ’ m sure you will . __eou__
 I didn't know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ? __eou__  We're identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else ! __eou__
 you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture ! __eou__  What's so interesting about it ? __eou__

 No hurry ! I'll tell you now .

I can't wait anymore . Let's go right now ! __eou__
 I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! __eou__  Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . __eou__
 It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! __eou__  Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo . __eou__

I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . __eou__  Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . __eou__
 Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . __eou__  Are you sure ? __eou__
 Are you sure ? __eou__  Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful . __eou__

 Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . __eou__  Oh , great idea ! __eou__
Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro . __eou__  Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ? __eou__
 It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month . __eou__  That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well . __eou__

 Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . And they are all newly renovated . __eou__  That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office . __eou__
 No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . __eou__  I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost . __eou__
 Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there . __eou__  Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ? __eou__
 Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place . __eou__  Ok . Thank you . __eou__

It's interesting to join them . __eou__

In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . __eou__  You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . __eou__

 Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . __eou__  A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , " When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . " __eou__

I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . __eou__  With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? __eou__
 My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work .

 Are they designed differently ? __eou__  A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars .

You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . __eou__

 Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . __eou__  Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . __eou__
 Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . __eou__  That's great for me . Look , children's clothes ! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . __eou__

Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? __eou__  I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner .

 I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner .

 I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . __eou__  Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ?

 Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . __eou__  So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? __eou__

 Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go .

 At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . __eou__  I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? __eou__
 I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? __eou__  Sure .

 Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . __eou__  I know it is quite different from Western chess . __eou__
 I know it is quite different from Western chess . __eou__  Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . __eou__
 Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . __eou__  But isn't it the same with wiki ? __eou__
 But isn't it the same with wiki ? __eou__  Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent .

I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ? __eou__  For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__
 For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__  I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders . __eou__
 I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders . __eou__  Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . __eou__
 Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . __eou__  Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . __eou__
 Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . __eou__  Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China . __eou__
 Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China . __eou__  There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . __eou__
 There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . __eou__  You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ? __eou__
 You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ? __eou__  Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances . __eou__

 But it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride . __eou__  I know . I will pay attention to such a thing next time . __eou__

Now I'm sure we'll never get all our things back . They're so clever these criminals . What's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ? __eou__  I only wish it were this time yesterday . __eou__
 I only wish it were this time yesterday . __eou__  Think how happy we were . Now this.Things always go wrong . __eou__
 Think how happy we were . Now this.Things always go wrong . __eou__  Perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . We'd feel better . __eou__
 Perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . We'd feel better . __eou__  I don't feel like breakfast . I don't feel like anything . Why are we so unlucky ? It's as if there were a jinx on us . __eou__
 I don't feel like breakfast . I don't feel like anything . Why are we so unlucky ? It's as if there were a jinx on us . __eou__  Perhaps I'd better ring the police ... __eou__
 Perhaps I'd better ring the police ... __eou__  Yes . Of course . But what good will it do ? That man's miles away from here by now . In our car . __eou__
 Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . __eou__  Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . __eou__
 Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . __eou__  Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? __eou__
 Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? __eou__  Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . __eou__
 Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . __eou__  How much did she ask for ? __eou__
 How much did she ask for ? __eou__  Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . __eou__
 Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . __eou__  She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? __eou__
 She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? __eou__  Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . __eou__
 Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . __eou__  Then you pretended to go without buying it ? __eou__
 Then you pretended to go without buying it ? __eou__  Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . ' __eou__
 cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? __eou__  yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . __eou__
 is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey . __eou__  but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? __eou__
Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class . __eou__  Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night . __eou__
 Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night . __eou__  Yes , Mum . __eou__
Is your father in the habit of having naps ? __eou__  Yes , all of us have naps . __eou__
 Yes , all of us have naps . __eou__  Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ? __eou__
 Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ? __eou__  No , not at all . __eou__
When do you go to bed usually ? __eou__  I go to bed at ten and get up at six . __eou__
 I go to bed at ten and get up at six . __eou__  That's helpful for your health . __eou__
 That's helpful for your health . __eou__  Sure . __eou__
Are you ready , Pa ? __eou__  In a second . Have you got a torch ? __eou__
 In a second . Have you got a torch ? __eou__  No . __eou__
 No . __eou__  Here it is . Let's go . __eou__
Let's see if we forget anything . __eou__  Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area . __eou__
 Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area . __eou__  Yes , let's go . Lock the door , please . __eou__
 Yes , let's go . Lock the door , please . __eou__  All right . __eou__
Do you like the cookies ? __eou__  I finished them in no time . __eou__
 I finished them in no time . __eou__  Glad you like it . __eou__

 OK , Mum , when will you be back ? __eou__  I'll be back in ten days . __eou__
Why is the car before us stopping ? __eou__  What's going on ? __eou__
 What's going on ? __eou__  Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops . __eou__
 Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops . __eou__  More and more people easily get irritated while driving . __eou__
 More and more people easily get irritated while driving . __eou__  Yes . This is what is called road rage . __eou__
Good evening , madam . Can I help you ? __eou__  Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday . __eou__
 Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday . __eou__  Anything wrong with it ? __eou__
 Anything wrong with it ? __eou__  Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole . __eou__
 Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole . __eou__  Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ? __eou__
 Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ? __eou__  Here it is . __eou__
 Here it is . __eou__  Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish . __eou__
 Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish . __eou__  That's very kind of you . Thank you . __eou__
Would you like a cigarette ? __eou__  No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking . __eou__
 No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking . __eou__  Really ? Why ? __eou__
 Really ? Why ? __eou__  Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . __eou__
 Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . __eou__  I see.You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? __eou__
 I see.You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? __eou__  That's right . You should give it up , too.It ' s bad for your health . __eou__
 That's right . You should give it up , too.It ' s bad for your health . __eou__  Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying . __eou__
 But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started.Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! __eou__  What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? __eou__
 What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? __eou__  I mean you couldn't give it up ! __eou__
What's your weight . __eou__  150 pounds . __eou__
 150 pounds . __eou__  Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . __eou__
 Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . __eou__  I can't bear eating less . __eou__
 By the way , do you work out ? __eou__  No , but I am starting working out from now on . __eou__
 No , but I am starting working out from now on . __eou__  Fine . __eou__
Are you a wrestler or a boxer ? __eou__  No.Why ? __eou__
 No.Why ? __eou__  Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . __eou__
 Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . __eou__  Oh , really ? I go to the gym every day . __eou__
I can see you've got some color back in your cheeks . __eou__  Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . __eou__
 Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . __eou__  You've formed a sound habit . __eou__
 You've formed a sound habit . __eou__  I think so , too . __eou__
Excuse me , ma'am ? __eou__  Yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__
 Yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__  I'm new here and I can ’ t seem to find the lunch room . __eou__
 I'm new here and I can ’ t seem to find the lunch room . __eou__  Oh , it ’ s right downstairs . I'm going there myself . Just follow me . __eou__
You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? __eou__  I attend an aerobic class three times a week . __eou__
 I attend an aerobic class three times a week . __eou__  Aren't you tired ? __eou__
 Aren't you tired ? __eou__  No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . __eou__
 It was okay . __eou__  Would you like a drink ? __eou__
 Would you like a drink ? __eou__  No thanks , I'm not thirsty . __eou__
 No thanks , I'm not thirsty . __eou__  Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ? __eou__
 Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ? __eou__  Not really . __eou__
 Not really . __eou__  Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ? __eou__
 Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ? __eou__  Yes I did . __eou__
 Yes I did . __eou__  Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ? __eou__
I'm going to the shops in a minute . What do we need ? __eou__  We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ? __eou__
 We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ? __eou__  No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday . We'll need balloons for that too . __eou__
 No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday .

 I'll see you later then . __eou__  Bye ! I'll be back before seven . __eou__
The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . __eou__  Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . __eou__
 Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . __eou__  No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . __eou__
 No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . __eou__  You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? __eou__
 You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? __eou__  Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . __eou__

Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . __eou__  Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? __eou__
 Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? __eou__  Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . __eou__
 Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . __eou__  Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? __eou__
 Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? __eou__  Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . __eou__
I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday . __eou__  Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ? __eou__
 Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ? __eou__  Yes , that would be good ! __eou__
 We need to think about what she might like . What are her interests ? __eou__  If I remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading . __eou__
 If I remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading . __eou__  You know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . Who would know her favorite groups ? __eou__
 You know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . Who would know her favorite groups ? __eou__  Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are . __eou__
 Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are . __eou__  Yeah , Malia would be able to help us choose a concert . __eou__
 Yeah , Malia would be able to help us choose a concert . __eou__  Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now . __eou__
 Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now . __eou__  Good ! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift . __eou__
In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . __eou__  Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off ! __eou__
 Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off ! __eou__  Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places . __eou__
 Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places . __eou__  Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . __eou__
 Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . __eou__  Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas . __eou__

People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas . __eou__  What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar . __eou__

Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar . __eou__  Well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . __eou__
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? __eou__  I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__
 I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__  You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__

 I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__  You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends . __eou__

 A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__  Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__
 Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__  I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . __eou__
Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . __eou__  You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__

It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__  So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__
 So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__  It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . __eou__

 So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? __eou__  Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . __eou__

 What does that imply , then ? __eou__  More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . __eou__

What reasons do westerners drink for ? __eou__  I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . __eou__
 I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . __eou__  I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . __eou__

You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . __eou__  Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . __eou__
 Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . __eou__  Yes .

 But it will pose a risk to your health . __eou__  Pardon ? __eou__
 I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems . __eou__  Well , I didn't realize that . __eou__
 Well , I didn't realize that . __eou__  I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . __eou__
 I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . __eou__  Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . __eou__
 Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . __eou__  Yes , good luck , Maria . __eou__

 high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . __eou__  It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood . __eou__

 It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen . __eou__  It's a bit small but looks nice . __eou__
 It's a bit small but looks nice . __eou__  What's more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . __eou__

 How about this afternoon ? __eou__  Fine . I'll be expecting you around two . __eou__
 That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there . __eou__  We're little further away from the street and traffic noise __eou__
 We're little further away from the street and traffic noise __eou__  And there's no one living over us . __eou__
 And there's no one living over us . __eou__  Is the place well-furnished ? __eou__

 What about the kitchen ? __eou__  The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , __eou__
 The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , __eou__  And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . __eou__
 And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . __eou__  Are the plumbing all right ? __eou__
 Are the plumbing all right ? __eou__  The plumbing seems OK , too . __eou__

 The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water __eou__  And the sinks don't seem to leak . __eou__
 And the sinks don't seem to leak . __eou__  The place is OK . Let's go there and have a look at it again . __eou__
Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? __eou__  Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . __eou__
 That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? __eou__  Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . __eou__
 Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . __eou__  True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . __eou__
 True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . __eou__  Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places . __eou__
 Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places . __eou__  Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not . __eou__
 Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not . __eou__  That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to . __eou__
 That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to . __eou__  I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . __eou__
 You're so careless , Billy . __eou__  Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . __eou__
My mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? __eou__  An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ? __eou__
 An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ? __eou__  Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . __eou__
 Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . __eou__  That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . __eou__
 That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . __eou__  That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . __eou__
 That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . __eou__  Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . __eou__
 Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . __eou__  That's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? __eou__
 That's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? __eou__  256MB . __eou__
 256MB . __eou__  Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I'm in a bit of a rush . Could I have a piece of apple pie please ? __eou__
 Yes , I'm in a bit of a rush . Could I have a piece of apple pie please ? __eou__  Certainly . Would you like it with ice cream ? __eou__
 Certainly . Would you like it with ice cream ? __eou__  No , thanks . __eou__
George , did you remember to buy me the book ? __eou__  Sorry , darling , I forgot . __eou__
 When will you buy it then ? __eou__  I promise you'll have it tomorrow . __eou__
Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue . __eou__  It is true . I think we should change some policies . __eou__
 It is true . I think we should change some policies . __eou__  Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts . __eou__
 Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts . __eou__  Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . __eou__
 Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . __eou__  Like you and me ! __eou__
Willy , I don't think we have much butter . Can you buy some ? __eou__  Sure , Mum.In a minute . __eou__

 Here's the money.And get some salt . __eou__  Yes , Mum . __eou__
I can't believe that . __eou__  What ? __eou__
 What ? __eou__  I've never heard Mary cursed anybody . But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today . __eou__
 I've never heard Mary cursed anybody . But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today . __eou__  Oh . Why did she do that ? __eou__
Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? __eou__  No , I'm not clear . __eou__
 No , I'm not clear . __eou__  we've spent $ 1,000 . __eou__
 we've spent $ 1,000 . __eou__  Don't make a fuss.The price is rising __eou__

When I looked down , I was nervous even more.If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . __eou__

Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? __eou__  Haven't been sleeping well recently . __eou__
 Haven't been sleeping well recently . __eou__  What's the problem ? __eou__
 What's the problem ? __eou__  Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . __eou__
 Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night .

 Well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down . __eou__  Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . __eou__
 Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . __eou__  I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . __eou__
 I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . __eou__  Yeah , I crave my own space . I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . We all need our private space .
