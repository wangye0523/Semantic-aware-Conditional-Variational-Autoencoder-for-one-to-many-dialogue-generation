 You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone . __eou__  I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time . __eou__

 I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ? __eou__  You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late . __eou__
 You only care about your work . __eou__  Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family . __eou__
 They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . __eou__  They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . __eou__
I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking . __eou__  I swear I never drink again . Just give me another chance , please . __eou__
 I swear I never drink again . Just give me another chance , please . __eou__  How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you . __eou__
 How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you . __eou__  You know how hard I try to quit , I've lost without you . I am mot let you go . __eou__
 You know how hard I try to quit , I've lost without you . I am mot let you go . __eou__  It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility . __eou__
 It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility . __eou__  I have to make money to support the family , so I have little time left to share with you . __eou__
 I have to make money to support the family , so I have little time left to share with you . __eou__  Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment . __eou__
 Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment . __eou__  I told you I happened to be more important meeting at that time . __eou__
 I'm sorry , I'm very tired . I'm going to bed early . I didn't have good time , and I don't really want to see you again . __eou__  What are you talking about ? We had a great time . We laughed and talked all night last time . __eou__
 It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes . __eou__  That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ? __eou__
 That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ? __eou__  No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye . __eou__
 No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye . __eou__  But Anne ... __eou__
Dam it , I'm running out of money again , I really need to balance my budget and handle my money better . __eou__  You did spend too much , and most of the expense was kind of unnecessary . __eou__
 Well , I'm really surprised . You are not doing anything behind my back , are you ? __eou__  No , the only thing I've ever done behind your back is zip you up , besides I told all my other girlfriends , and my wife who's getting suspicious . and we had a cold for a while , tell the __eou__
 Haha ... You are not very funny . I guess that means - - except me to tell my lover we have stoped seeing each other too . __eou__  You are not funny either . I can't believe I married a woman like you . __eou__
 Why are you so bitter ? No one tells worse joke than you . __eou__  Administer is doing a good job . I'm not sure they'll be as happy as we are . __eou__
 Not so well . I've come down with the flu . __eou__  I ’ m sorry to hear that.Take care of yourself . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry to hear that.Take care of yourself . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
Sally , do you really need to go ? __eou__  Yeah.It ' s a must for me . __eou__
Darling , can't you stay for a few more days ? __eou__  I can't . I've got to attend a meeting in London . __eou__
I'm leaving now , mum . __eou__  Take care , sonny ! __eou__
 Yes , and the food was horrible ! __eou__  Oh , sorry to hear that . But , don worry ! Taiwan has plenty of great things to eat . First , lets get you to the hotel . __eou__
 Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ? __eou__  I really have to go . __eou__
 Why ? I still wanted to talk to you . __eou__  I have things to do . __eou__
 Don't be nosey . __eou__  I'm not . I just want to know . __eou__
 That's harsh . __eou__  I'm sorry , but I have to go . __eou__
 Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ? __eou__  I've got to go . __eou__
 I wasn't done talking to you . __eou__  I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey . __eou__
 I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey . __eou__  I'm not being nosey . I'm just asking . __eou__
 I really don't think it's any of your business . __eou__  That's not nice . __eou__
 That's not nice . __eou__  I apologize , but I'm getting off the phone now . __eou__
 What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation ? __eou__  You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us ! __eou__
 You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us ! __eou__  Really ? Who made that rule up ? __eou__
 Really ? Who made that rule up ? __eou__  With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here . __eou__
 With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here . __eou__  That works for me ! __eou__
 Are you kidding me ? __eou__  You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? __eou__
 You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? __eou__  We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . __eou__
 We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . __eou__  I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? __eou__
 I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? __eou__  Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well ! __eou__
 Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well ! __eou__  I am really looking forward to getting away from you . Far away from you ! __eou__
 You can't be serious ! __eou__  Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . __eou__
 Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . __eou__  After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . __eou__
 After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . __eou__  Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . __eou__
 Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . __eou__  You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! __eou__
 You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! __eou__  Whatever you say ! __eou__
It's an ugly day today . __eou__  I know . I think it may rain . __eou__
 It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer . __eou__  It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . __eou__
 Any rain right now would be pointless . __eou__  That's right , it really would be . __eou__
 My fish is pretty dry too . __eou__  It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh . __eou__
 It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh . __eou__  Yes , it seems that way to me also . __eou__
 Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked . __eou__  I don't usually complain , but I think that we should mention this to the waiter . __eou__
 I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice . __eou__  I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup . __eou__
 The food wasn't all that exciting . __eou__  I don't think that the service was good , either . __eou__
Hi . I just lost my purse when I was shopping on the street . I guess somebody stole it from me . __eou__  Sorry to hear that . Could you tell me what were in your purse ? __eou__
Excuse me . This chicken doesn't taste right to me . __eou__  What seems to be the problem ? __eou__
 How should I know ? It's just kind of cold in the middle . It just doesn't taste right . Do you want to try it ? __eou__  Well , let me get that out of your way . Would you like to order something else from the menu ? Or I could bring you another order of chicken if you'd like . __eou__
Excuse me . Who is the person responsible for handling complaints here ? I would like to make a few complaints . __eou__  I am the manager here . You can complain to me . How may I help you ? __eou__
 Here is the thing . I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night . Even I unplugged it , it wouldn't stop beeping . I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room . So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room . __eou__  I apologize for everything disturbing you . We will give another room to you right now . Please wait a moment . __eou__
 Isn't that a bit excessive ? __eou__  I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy . __eou__
 Well , I hate to disturb you , but I really can't stand it any more . Can you change my room for me ? It's too noisy . I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . It was too much for me . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . This room is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when everything is quiet . __eou__
 I'm scared . __eou__  Don't worry . The pilot knows what he's doing . __eou__
I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ? __eou__  I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel . __eou__
 You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? __eou__  I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here . __eou__
 Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . __eou__  I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass . __eou__
 Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head , bone head , bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand . ) . __eou__  Calm down , sir . You are creating a commotion . __eou__
 Oh , how annoying ! __eou__  The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible . __eou__
 What a pity ! __eou__  Where shall we go now ? __eou__
 I want to go fishing today , but I have left my rod and fishing line at home . __eou__  What a shame . __eou__
 I have just got lost with my friends . Would you please help me find them ? __eou__  Sure . We will make a broadcast for you . May I have your name , please ? __eou__
 Yes , I joined your group of bus tour this morning . You promised the journey will last 3 hours and we will visit 15 sightseeing spots . __eou__  Yes , sir . We promised that . __eou__
 But have 2 - hour journey . __eou__  Really ? I am sorry , sir . We will look into this matter . Would you please wait a moment here ? __eou__
 Yes . I have my wallet stolen . __eou__  When did you lose it ? __eou__
 Really ? What can I do now ? I can't miss the important meeting . __eou__  I am so sorry to hear that . Maybe you should go to the information counter over there . They can give you some advice . __eou__
 That sounds like a nightmare ! __eou__  It wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . __eou__
 Oh , my god . If this flight is late . I will for Sydney.What can I do now ? __eou__  Well if so.you should contact with the office over there.Maybe they will do you some help . __eou__
 Wait a minute . I am really sorry but I can't find it now . __eou__  You must have left it somewhere . __eou__
 Granted , it ’ s cheap , but the place is filthy , the beds are uncomfortable , there ’ s no A / C , the breakfast is pretty skimpy ... and the staff couldn ’ t care less about the guests . __eou__  Oh . I guess you get what you pay for . How long did you stay there ? __eou__
 Just one night , when my flight was canceled due to bad weather . It ’ s bearable if you just need a place to crash , but you definitely don ’ t want to book a vacation there . Unless you enjoy sharing your room with cockroaches . __eou__  Hmm , I ’ ll pass . Hopefully I can find a decent place that won ’ t cost a fortune . __eou__
 I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . __eou__  I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet . __eou__
 Well . I can't find my key now . I think I have lost it . __eou__  Really ? Have you left it in your room ? __eou__
 I have made a reservation for my breakfast last night . But I still haven't got it . I am so hungry now . __eou__  I am sorry.sir , I will check for you.what ' s your room number ? __eou__
 Yes . I can't find my sweater . I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done . I find my swatter missing . __eou__  Well , it's our fault.We are sorry for that.Would you please fill out the form ? We will pay for you . __eou__
 This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning . __eou__  Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ? __eou__
 I was taking a walk when a young man came at me from nowhere and snatched the bag off my hands and ran away . __eou__  What did the young man look like ? __eou__
I have a complaint to make . I've just been badly treated by a rude maid . __eou__  Well , we are sorry to hear that.May I have your name and room number ? We will deal with the matter right now . __eou__
I'm sorry . I've lost my tags and receipt . How can I do about it ? __eou__  I see . What is your baggage ? And do not remember the tag's number or color ? __eou__
I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room . __eou__  Well , sir . May I have your room number ? __eou__
 Oh , how annoying ! __eou__  The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible . __eou__
 To be honest , I was just dumped . __eou__  Oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday cheer you up . __eou__
 Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head . __eou__  Calm down , sir . You are creating a commotion . __eou__
Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . __eou__  Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__
 What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd ! __eou__  I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . __eou__
 Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . __eou__  Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . __eou__
 I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . __eou__  That's all right . Enjoy your flight . __eou__
 I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . __eou__  That's all right.Enjoy your flight . __eou__
 I should have booked the tickets in advance . __eou__  Take it easy . I'll like you know if anyone decides to cancel his reservation . __eou__
I am sorry to say this but I seem to have lost the key to the safe . __eou__  Where do you think you lost it ? Outside the hotel ? __eou__
 I feel kind of stupid . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . __eou__  You got lost . You're kidding ! __eou__
 Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ? __eou__  Sir , if it makes you feel any better , the $ 2 service fee used to be $ 5 . __eou__
 Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have ? __eou__  Unfortunately , sir , you'll have to pay the $ 2 , whether you like it or not . __eou__
My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . __eou__  Let's see . It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p . m . for the movie ' Titanic . ' __eou__
 That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . __eou__  Okay , let me see what I can do for you . __eou__
 Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? __eou__  Unfortunately , sir , it's how the computer is programmed . __eou__
 This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! __eou__  I'm sorry , sir . Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters . __eou__
You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw . __eou__  Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening . __eou__
 Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night . __eou__  Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please . __eou__
 Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ? __eou__  Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer . __eou__
 This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police ! __eou__  If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way . __eou__
I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . __eou__  Let me check , sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night . __eou__
 That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night . __eou__  Okay , sir , bear with me a moment . __eou__
 Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves . __eou__  I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here . __eou__
Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ? __eou__  Sir , according to your file , you spent Monday evening watching ' Titanic . ' __eou__
 You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made ! __eou__  Sometimes you can't win for losing , sir . __eou__
 Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is ! __eou__  I don't blame you , sir . Two dollars is a lot of money . __eou__
 I've told you a thousand times . I don't want to go in the Haunted House.It ' s too scary ! __eou__  Well . Maybe I'll go alone then . I really don't want to miss it . __eou__
 Oh , honey ! Don ’ t you remember this important day to us ? __eou__  Sorry . __eou__
 I ’ m a little nervous . I ’ Ve never flown before . __eou__  There ’ s nothing at all to worry about . Once you are in the air , it ’ s just like sitting at your sitting room . It ’ s going to be a very pleasant flight . __eou__
 Someone has stolen my gold necklace . __eou__  I am sorry to hear about that . Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me exactly what happened here ? __eou__
 Yes , I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back . __eou__  Well , I understand how you feel , and we will try to do our best to help you . But first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly , just in case it's still in there . If she finds it , we will all be happy . If she doesn't , we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ’ s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so . __eou__
 That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now . __eou__  I am sorry , ma ’ am . Our general manager is not in town . But I ’ d be more than glad to get you our assistant manager , if you like . But I am afraid that he will say the same thing . We have very clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them . And now if you will excuse me , I'll go and find our assistant manager for you . __eou__
I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch . __eou__  Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ? __eou__
 I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhaust but I can't sleep . __eou__  All right madam , I'll check and tell them to be quiet . __eou__
I can't get into my room . I mean I left my room key inside . __eou__  I see , sir . Those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago . __eou__
 Gross . Diarrhea ? __eou__  It's not so bad . __eou__
Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now . __eou__  Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken . __eou__
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__  Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . __eou__
 I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago . __eou__  What seems to be the trouble now ? __eou__
 Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch . __eou__  And what about dinner ? __eou__
 I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts . __eou__  Have you got a headache ? __eou__
 Yes , I ache all over . __eou__  Are you coughing much ? __eou__
 It's gone completely . __eou__  Show me your tongue , please . All right , stay in bed and keep yourself warm . I'll prescribe some pills for you to take . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
 I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . __eou__  I see.When did it start ? __eou__
 It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper . __eou__  Have you got a temperature ? __eou__
 Okay , thank you . I'll make another reservation as soon as I can . __eou__  It's been my pleasure to help you . __eou__
 I'm afraid I've got a terrible cold . What should I do ? __eou__  Have you taken any medicine ? __eou__
 Yes , but I'm not feeling very better now . Actually I'm feeling even worse . __eou__  Well , if I were you , I'd go to see the doctor . That might help . And you'd better stay in bed today instead of going to work . __eou__
 I wish everything in life was so simple . Thank you . __eou__  Not a problem , sir . Please remember us in the future . __eou__
I have a terrible toothache . __eou__  Which tooth is it ? __eou__
I'm very worried , doctor . I'm afraid that I'm very ill . __eou__  Why do you think so ? __eou__
 Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find it very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . __eou__  How do you sleep ? __eou__
 Very badly , doctor . __eou__  Are you worried about anything ? __eou__
 Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake . __eou__  Well , there's nothing much wrong with you . You're under too much pressure . __eou__
A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too . __eou__  Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ? __eou__
I've got a headache and sore throat . __eou__  How long have you had it ? __eou__
 I've got a headache and a cough . __eou__  I see . You've got a cold . __eou__
 Yes , a low fever . I feel terrible . Am I dying ? __eou__  Certainly not . Take one of these white pills three times a day . __eou__
Doctor , save my baby , please __eou__  What symptoms does he have ? __eou__
 Oh my god . Please save her life . __eou__  We ’ ll try our best , but you'd better prepare for the worst . __eou__
 I have said that we will try our best . You can trust us . But you know her situation . __eou__  How long do you expect her to live ? __eou__
 How dare you question my statement ! __eou__  Forgive me . You're 100 percent correct . Allow me to transfer you to my supervisor . __eou__
 There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief ! __eou__  I apologize . One moment , please , while I transfer you to my supervisor . __eou__
 You dare to doubt me ? __eou__  I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor . __eou__
 I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you ! __eou__  You're right , sir . Please let me transfer you to my supervisor __eou__
 Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant . __eou__  I apologize , sir . Just a second , while I transfer you to my supervisor . __eou__
 You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement ! __eou__  I'm very sorry , sir . Will you please hold while I transfer you to my supervisor ? __eou__
 I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches ! __eou__  My apologies , sir . We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund . __eou__
 I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches ! __eou__  Oh , my gosh , they're back ? Another room at once , sir , plus a full refund , of course . __eou__
This room is unfit for humans . I want another room , and I want a refund for tonight . __eou__  Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem , sir . __eou__
 In a word , cockroaches ! __eou__  Oh , no , are they back ? I'll give you another room immediately , sir , and a refund for tonight . __eou__
I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight ! __eou__  If you tell me the exact problem , I can be more helpful . __eou__
 Cockroaches have declared war on my room ! __eou__  Allow me to apologize . I'll give you another room right now , and a full refund for tonight . __eou__
 Is it gonna hurt ? __eou__  No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . __eou__
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__  Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . __eou__
 I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . __eou__  Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! __eou__
 Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! __eou__  What ’ s wrong ? __eou__
 I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me ! __eou__  Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . __eou__
 Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! __eou__  Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . __eou__
Everything's gone wrong . __eou__  I know , it's not as I had planned . __eou__
 I know , it's not as I had planned . __eou__  What are we going to do now ? __eou__
 What are we going to do now ? __eou__  I'll speak to Bob , he'll be able to help us . __eou__
Doctor , I have the worst toothache ! __eou__  How long have you had this pain ? __eou__
 Perhaps , but I haven ’ t felt well for a few days now . __eou__  Has anything been upsetting you lately ? __eou__
 My stress level is pretty much what is usually is . __eou__  Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , Lucy . I'm afraid that I can't get up . __eou__  I think that the doctor had better see you . I'll telephone Dr Carter . The doctor says that he will come at once . I'm sure that you need an X-ray , Andy . __eou__
 I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . __eou__  It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! __eou__
 Yes , I took my temperature last night . It was 102 degrees . But right now I feel my fevers is up to 103 degrees . __eou__  Anything else bothering you ? __eou__
 I can not stop coughing , and I can not stop sneezing . I vomited blood last night . Sorry , I am coughing again . __eou__  Well , you can come to a work-in clinic today . You do not need an appointment . __eou__
 I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything . __eou__  Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain __eou__
 I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . __eou__  It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! __eou__
 I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today . __eou__  My goodness ! Are you OK ? __eou__
 I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school . __eou__  Oh , my God ! I hope you are all right . __eou__
 I ’ m pretty tired . I haven ’ t been sleeping well . __eou__  Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep ? __eou__
 I don ’ t have one time in particular . I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired . __eou__  Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? __eou__
 I just lost my job , and I am unsure about being able to find another one . __eou__  Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ? __eou__
 I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition . __eou__  You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head . __eou__
 Now I know that something bad is up ! __eou__  Just relax . We will talk about it this afternoon . __eou__
 I know for sure that something is wrong ! __eou__  Don ’ t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking . __eou__
 My mother just passed away last Tuesday . __eou__  I ’ m sorry . How about sleep ? Are you getting enough rest ? __eou__
 You are scaring me ! __eou__  Come on in this afternoon and we will talk . It will be fine ! __eou__
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__  Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . __eou__
 Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . __eou__  Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ? __eou__
 Oh , my god . __eou__  We are terribly sorry for that.Could you please buy a new one and give us the receipt ? We will refund the cost of the laundry and the new sweater . __eou__
 It's fine . What beautiful scenery outside the window ! I think this one will do . __eou__  I am glad you like it . __eou__

 Really ? __eou__  Can I get off the ship and walk around ? __eou__
 You see this is the first time for me to use the swimming pool . I've got no idea about the water temperature of the pool . I'm afraid it might be a little cold . __eou__  You don't need to worry about that . madam . We have a warm massage pool , and the temperature is 36 ° C . __eou__

 Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ? __eou__  Sure . __eou__
I think it might be a good idea to work as a guide . __eou__  Where do you intend to go ? __eou__
 The exhibits are really special . I enjoy the paintings very much . __eou__  So do I . This is Broadway.There are lots of theaters . This way leads to Times Square . __eou__
 I like the sight and the sound.It worked on me like a magic when I was a child . __eou__  Your dream will come true.It ' s really breathtaking . __eou__
What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . __eou__  I'm glad you like it . The bell is on the bedside . Just ring if you want anything . The room attendant speaks a little English . So I don't think you'll have any trouble . __eou__
This Olympic park is so big ! __eou__  Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park . __eou__
 Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ? __eou__  The whole stadium is to be finished this June . __eou__
 I didn ’ t know it would be so big ! __eou__  It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there . __eou__
 Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! __eou__  Why are they all in glass boxes ? __eou__
 The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! __eou__  Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ? __eou__
 Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions ! __eou__  Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing . __eou__
 Milestones ? May , you must be kidding . __eou__  Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system . __eou__
 Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . __eou__  I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass . __eou__
 What ? __eou__  It's just sleeping pills made in America which is also very good . But don't worry . It has no undesirable side-effects . __eou__
 I had a wonderful time . The rooms are not very big , but they are well furnished . The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced . There ’ s a sauna and a Jacuzzi . __eou__  Do they have a swimming pool ? __eou__
 It ’ s very good . Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends . __eou__  It sounds perfect . Did you have any complaints at all ? __eou__
 Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . __eou__  The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . __eou__
 His residence ? You mean the whole palace ? __eou__  Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The southern section , or the Outer Court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the Inner Court was for his royal family . __eou__
 Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious . __eou__  Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor . __eou__
 Oh , it's really fabulous . I wanna take a picture here . __eou__  Sure , this will be a really good picture . __eou__
What a nice day ! __eou__  Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? __eou__
 Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? __eou__  Great , let's go ! __eou__
 Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . __eou__  Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__
 Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__  Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! __eou__
 Why not go again to celebrate our one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . __eou__  Are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short voice ? __eou__
 Ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . __eou__  Wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . __eou__
Hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? __eou__  I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . __eou__
 Really ? I didn't expect that . __eou__  It's possible because everyone wants to travel during the holiday weekend . __eou__
 Really ? That's very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . __eou__  You needn't buy one . You can have mine . __eou__
 Really ? Maybe I ’ ll do that then . __eou__  Ok well , you let me know your schedule and I ’ ll book a ticket for you . __eou__
 Great . Make sure you buy me a souvenir ! __eou__  Oh , don ’ t worry , I will ! __eou__
What a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! __eou__  That would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . __eou__
 That's so kind of you . Thank you very much ! __eou__  You're welcome . Now smile ... __eou__
 Oh , thank you kindly . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 Ok , well enjoy the rest of your stay here . __eou__  Thank you very much . Bye . __eou__
 That ’ s great . How much is it ? __eou__  2000 Hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government tax . __eou__
 That ’ s fine . __eou__  But , ladies , the room ’ s not yet ready . It will be delay about half an hour . Perhaps you can fill the registration form first . And rest at the lobby for a while . We ’ ll let you know when the room ‘ s ready . __eou__
 Alright . thanks . __eou__  Ladies , Hotel policy requires one nine of room charge as deposit . __eou__
 Oh , thanks a lot . __eou__  I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others . __eou__
 Never mind , it doesn't matter . __eou__  If you have any more laundry , please just leave it in the laundry bag behind the bathroom door . The laundryman comes to collect it every morning . __eou__
 What ? 100 US dollars ? Is it covered by the insurance ? __eou__  I am afraid no . It is not covered by this insurance . __eou__
 Thank you very much ! __eou__  You are welcome ! Have a nice flight . __eou__
 You got lost . You're kidding ! __eou__  No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . __eou__
 Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? __eou__  I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . __eou__
 I hope so . I really hope so . __eou__  Hah , hah ! See ? I guessed right . You weren't watching the road at all . __eou__
 Hah , hah ! See ? I guessed right . You weren't watching the road at all . __eou__  No , I wasn't . It's kind of hard to watch the road when Joseph is behind the wheel . __eou__
 Thank you . It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly . __eou__  When I deleted the $ 10 , the computer automatically added a $ 2 service charge . __eou__
 That's fine . __eou__  It won't be long until your food is delivered . I know you'll enjoy it . __eou__
 Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs ! __eou__  Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs . __eou__
 You ’ Ve been very helpful . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
 I understand . Thank you very much ! __eou__  Have a great trip . __eou__
 Look at that village ! __eou__  Beautiful . __eou__

 Thanks very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 You have never gone to the Statue of Liberty ? ! I can't believe it ! But you live here ! __eou__  Yes , but I'm very busy with work.And you know how it is , sometimes people don't visit the tourist sites in their own country . __eou__
Alice , it really was great . I think it was the most interesting thing here . You really should go in . __eou__  No , I don't want to . __eou__
 Really . The special effects are fantastic.You shouldn't be scared . You would really enjoy it . __eou__  Sam , I never like Haunted Houses.When I was a kid , I didn't like them . when I was in high school , I didn't like them.when I was in college , I didn't like them . So why should I like them now ? __eou__
 We still have most of the tickets we bought.We can go on a lot of different rides if you like . __eou__  I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides.The other rides are for kids . __eou__
 What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ? __eou__  No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Have a nice day . __eou__
 Have a nice day . __eou__  You , too . __eou__
 No kidding ! We'll miss the connecting flight . __eou__  Oh , will you ? That's too bad.We ' re very sorry to cause you a lot of trouble . __eou__
 That's remarkable . __eou__  There are so many ancient relics in China . __eou__
 What ! One hundred U . S . dollars.Is it covered by the insurance ? __eou__  I'm afraid no.It is not covered by this insurance . __eou__

 Oh , no . I ’ m leaving for Japan at eleven this morning . __eou__  Is that right ? We are very sorry __eou__
 This sounds better every second . Now , when can I use the stations ? __eou__  If you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m . __eou__

 Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? __eou__  Yes , ten days . __eou__
 How beautiful they are ! Thank you so much . __eou__  I've also brought some magazines for you . I hope they'll keep you from getting bored while you're in the hospital . __eou__

 It's very kind of you . __eou__  You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery.Goodbye . __eou__
 Great ! Will you please tell me how to take it ? __eou__  Yes , madam . Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck . Or stew Cordyceps with chicken . __eou__

 Fantastic ! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ? __eou__  I hate cigarettes ! Nonsmoking . __eou__

 No , thanks . I am very grateful that you can come to the hospital to visit me . __eou__  You are my best friend . That's what I should do . Please don ’ t be a stranger . __eou__
 Would you prefer to come in in the morning or the afternoon ? __eou__  In the morning , if possible . __eou__
 But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! __eou__  Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . __eou__
 Is that so ? But I think It shouldn't keep you long in bed . __eou__  Yes . I hope so . __eou__
