 I hate dentists . __eou__  Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . __eou__
 It always hurts . I hate going . __eou__  Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . __eou__
 Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . __eou__  Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! __eou__
 Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . __eou__  Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . __eou__
 Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . __eou__  Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . __eou__
 Is it gonna hurt ? __eou__  No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . __eou__
Good morning , doctor . I've been suffering very much from a toothache lately . __eou__  Well , let me have a look . Will you sit down in this chair and open your mouth wide ? __eou__
 Oh , I hate having teeth pulled out . Will it hurt ? __eou__  No need to worry . You won't feel anything at all . I'll give you an injection to stop the pain . Just wash your mouth out with this water , will you ? __eou__
 But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football ! __eou__  You ’ Ve god a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ? __eou__
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . Are you sure ? __eou__  I'm afraid so . I'm terribly sorry . __eou__
 It sucks . But Arden told me he's satisfied with my qualifications and experience . __eou__  He's the only one of the several to decide this . __eou__
 How am I going to face the fellows in our office ? They thought I would be promoted . They must be waiting for my good news . __eou__  I don't think the thing can be that serious . You should face the result . Besides , I don't think the position is the best for you . __eou__
 But I lost the chance . __eou__  Keep working hard , and then you will get another chance of promotion someday . __eou__
Sorry , I overslept . My clock didn't go off this morning . __eou__  Again ? __eou__
 What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now . __eou__  But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ? __eou__
 It seems that I have nothing to do , except this . __eou__  Face the reality . Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss . __eou__
 I see . __eou__  We considered you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience . __eou__
Mr . Wang , I want to apologize for being late again this morning . I just can't get up in time for work . __eou__  So it seems . And what are you going to do about that ? __eou__
 I really can't work overtime . Because my husband has been ill recently , I must take care of him . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . Take good care of your husband . I'll find another one to replace you . __eou__
 Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat . __eou__  It's in the eyes . They're the type that seems to look into your soul , making one really uneasy . __eou__
 I've been fed up with study . __eou__  But whether you like it or not , there ’ s a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society . And you need to accept this concept positively . __eou__
 Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ? __eou__  You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time . __eou__
 Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . __eou__  Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around . __eou__
 I cut it on that blade . __eou__  I'll get the first aid box . There's some antiseptic cream and a bandage in there . __eou__
 Give me a break , Mr Yang . __eou__  Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ? __eou__
Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me . __eou__  Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 . __eou__
 But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties . __eou__  YOU GET ME ! __eou__
 Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly . __eou__  Oh , I'm sorry about that . __eou__
 Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ? __eou__  Don't worry , we'll soon fix them . __eou__
 Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job . __eou__  Why don't you go over the resumes again ? They might help you decide who to hire . __eou__
 They turned me down . __eou__  Why ? You are so excellent . __eou__
 I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to . __eou__  What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them ! __eou__
 What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them ! __eou__  It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies . __eou__
 Silly me . __eou__  Now press this button . __eou__
 Although I am a little shocked , I can deal with it pretty well . I didn't perform as well as I should have in the interview . __eou__  Maybe . But you should not withdraw forever just because you failed once . __eou__
Hi , Alan . I feel very nervous because I am going to have a job interview next Monday . Could you please give me some suggestions ? __eou__  Sure . Firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . Interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic . __eou__
 I am sorry to tell you that I have lost the opportunity . __eou__  Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job . __eou__
 Nothing . It's just one of those days . Everyone at the office is sick and I'm getting blamed for work not being done . __eou__  Maybe you need a vacation or something , or maybe a bonus . __eou__
 I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right . __eou__  Why don't you talk to your boss about it ? If you talk to him , he will surely understand . __eou__
 It certainly didn't arrive here that way . __eou__  We'll make it right with you , of course . __eou__
 I feel terrible now . __eou__  Don't be discouraged . Just keep trying and you will find a job eventually . __eou__
 Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . __eou__  Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ? __eou__
 No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line . __eou__  Well , I think you may be overreacting . Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing . __eou__
 Today , I am busy all day long . __eou__  Shall I see you on Friday morning ? __eou__
 Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . __eou__  That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . __eou__
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine . __eou__  What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? __eou__
 I'm very sorry to hear that . __eou__  Please handle future shipments with more care . __eou__
 Oh , sorry to interrupt you . But I am calling to say goodbye to you . I am awfully sorry to tell you that I am afraid I could not see you off at the airport tomorrow , because I will have to attend a very important meeting . __eou__  It doesn't matter , Mr.Lin . I can understand . I know you are always very busy . Work must come first . __eou__
The time has come to say goodbye . __eou__  So soon . It seems as if you just got here . __eou__
 I don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__  It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . __eou__
 To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__  Why ? What happened ? __eou__
 Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__  That's not very fair . What did you do ? __eou__
 There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . __eou__  Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__
 He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__  Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__
 I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__  Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ? __eou__
 It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__  I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__
 Did I do something wrong ? __eou__  You're the sales manager , but our sales didn't go up . __eou__
 But you know I've been working very hard . And I have a family to support . __eou__  I feel sorry , but that's the decision of the directorate . __eou__
Please forgive me for rushing into your room forgetting to knock at the door . __eou__  Never mind . __eou__
 I'm so sorry to disturb you so early . __eou__  It doesn't matter . __eou__
 I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . __eou__  Not a bit of it , don't blame yourself . __eou__
I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent . __eou__  You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you . __eou__
I beg your pardon for being late . __eou__  Better late than never . __eou__
 So sorry , I don't mean to be . __eou__  That's perfectly all right . __eou__
I'm terrible sorry . I seem to have mislaid your MP4 . __eou__  Don't worry about that . __eou__
 Very sorry that I have caused you so much trouble . __eou__  No trouble at all . __eou__
 Please accept my deep apology . __eou__  I never did like this MP4 anyway . I won't hear of it . __eou__
I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime . __eou__  Does your boss pay you for the over-time work ? __eou__
 We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management . __eou__  I suggest that you go to the lawyers ' office to get some help . __eou__
 That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy.Will he be back soon ? __eou__  I'm afraid not.He ' s gone for the rest of the day . __eou__
Gordon , you're ever so late . __eou__  Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . __eou__
 Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . __eou__  But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . __eou__
 But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . __eou__  Well , I missed several buses . __eou__
 Well , I missed several buses . __eou__  How on earth can you miss several buses ? __eou__
 How on earth can you miss several buses ? __eou__  I , ah ... , I got have late . __eou__
 I , ah ... , I got have late . __eou__  Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? __eou__
 Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? __eou__  Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ... __eou__
 That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ? __eou__  I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day . __eou__
 Well , frankly speaking , I am running a little behind . It's 40 % done . __eou__  Do you have any problem during the process ? You should speed things up . __eou__
 I have little chance to communicate with colleagues when I have problems . They are always too busy to help a green hand like me . __eou__  Have you ever helped others when they are in trouble ? Most will give a hand to someone who has helped him . __eou__
 I did . But I am so depressed because there is nobody that will help me . __eou__  And you should have good co-operation with other colleagues , you know a scientific schedule brings efficiency to the work . __eou__
 I see your point , but I seem to be on bad terms with them . __eou__  Cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better . I am speaking from my experience . __eou__
 I know you , Zina . You're only nice when you want something . __eou__  If we want to beat WebTracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand . __eou__
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable . __eou__  Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__  I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__
 I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__  Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss . __eou__
 Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__  Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper ! __eou__
 Don't laugh at me , please . I'm serious . I've never been required to write this kind of report before , I only do the research reports . __eou__  Oh , sorry , I've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic . __eou__
I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . __eou__  You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . __eou__
 Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . __eou__  Is that so ? __eou__
 Excuse me ? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard . __eou__  I know it's awkward , but you're going to be thanking me later . I'm going to make you rich . __eou__
 That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . __eou__  Oh , I get it . Simply put , you're bored , huh ? __eou__
 I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . __eou__  Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . __eou__
 I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . __eou__  We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest . __eou__
 I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself . __eou__  So do I . __eou__
 Bull . I're done my research . I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options . __eou__  Who told you that ? __eou__
 Do you think I believe the story like that ? __eou__  But it's true . __eou__
 How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? __eou__  That's coincidence 。 __eou__
 It's unfair . __eou__  We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . __eou__
 I got the message . I'm quiting . __eou__  Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times.and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . __eou__
 I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time.If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . __eou__  I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . __eou__
We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future . __eou__  Yes . I promise it will not happen again . __eou__
 No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support . __eou__  Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place . __eou__
 I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . __eou__  Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . __eou__
 I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting . __eou__  Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ? __eou__
What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , I feel really down . __eou__  What ’ s up ? __eou__
 Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday . __eou__  Anything that distracts you from work ? __eou__
 Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . __eou__  Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ? __eou__
 I apologize . This should not have to be this way . __eou__  Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . __eou__
I'm really in a flap about the interview . __eou__  Take it easy.you ' Ve made enough preparations . __eou__
 I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes . __eou__  I'm sure you'll pass it . __eou__
 I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . __eou__  Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . __eou__
 I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . __eou__  Why don't you take a few days off ? __eou__
 Not very long from the looks of it ! __eou__  Look ! He has a partner ! __eou__
 Gross ! __eou__  The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss . __eou__
 But I think Eddy is going too far ! __eou__  You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ... __eou__
 They're picking a name ... It's ... Darryl from marketing ! Rats ! __eou__  Don't worry ! There are a lot more prizes ! I know , because the prizes are all from companies that I work with ! __eou__
 He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! __eou__  Oh , no ! I did a lot of bad things this year . I hope the kitchen god isn't like Lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody ! __eou__
 Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! __eou__  Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you . __eou__
 Our red underwear didn't do any good at all ! __eou__  Well , there are still some consolation prizes . We can go up to the front and pick them up . __eou__
 Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! __eou__  I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . __eou__
 Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . __eou__  It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . __eou__
 What ! I resent that ! __eou__  Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! __eou__
 Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! __eou__  Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__
 You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? __eou__  Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . __eou__
 Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . __eou__  I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! __eou__
 I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! __eou__  I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . __eou__
Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . __eou__  Just give me a second . I'll be right up . I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! __eou__
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! __eou__  Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__  I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__
 I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__  Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . __eou__
 Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__  Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . __eou__
 I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? __eou__  I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . __eou__
 You said the same thing three months ago . __eou__  Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . __eou__
 You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? __eou__  Yes . __eou__
 Silly me ! __eou__  Now press this button . __eou__
 Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__  You certainly had a busy day . __eou__
Excuse me sir . May I come in ? __eou__  Mike , you're late again . __eou__
 Mike , you're late again . __eou__  I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I __eou__
 I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I __eou__  Do you think I believe the story like that ? __eou__
 Do you think I believe the story like that ? __eou__  But it's true . __eou__
 How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? __eou__  That's coincident 。 __eou__
 I know , but I am really sick . __eou__  Well . I want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here . __eou__
 Today , I am busy all day long . __eou__  Shall I see you on Friday morning ? __eou__
 Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . __eou__  What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? __eou__
 I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... __eou__  Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? __eou__
How come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__  You mean the network connection ? __eou__
 It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . __eou__  That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . __eou__
 Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . __eou__  But if the company asks , what else can we do ? __eou__
 It was a nightmare . __eou__  What ’ s up ? __eou__
 Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__  This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__
 I am still waiting for their call . __eou__  Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . __eou__
 Oh , that's right . You are supposed to deliver a brief on that account tomorrow . I know there are some things I need to share with you about that . But , gosh , I don't know ... Things are really busy for me today , the only time I can manage to squeeze out might be over lunch break ... __eou__  I hate to make you work through your lunch break with how busy you are ... __eou__
 You ’ re questioning my ability ? I tell ya , I can make it ! I ’ ll talk to your boss . __eou__  Mr . Black , I don ’ t think my boss will talk to you . It ’ s a Chinaman ’ s chance . __eou__
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__  That bad , huh ? __eou__
 Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . __eou__  Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__
And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . __eou__  I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . __eou__
 Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . __eou__  No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... __eou__
 But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__  Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! __eou__
 You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? __eou__  Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . __eou__
 I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! __eou__  I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . __eou__
 Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it . __eou__  Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great . __eou__
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__  That bad , huh ? __eou__
 Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . __eou__  Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__
 I got laid off today . __eou__  Oh no ! That ’ s terrible ! __eou__
 Oh , my computer crashed again ! __eou__  Can I help ? __eou__
 Come on ! What have you got to lose ? __eou__  What about my resume ? __eou__
Mr . Division , I am so sorry to have kept you waiting . __eou__  That's quite all right . __eou__
 Oh dear , I forgot to bring it . __eou__  Not too worry , so tell me about yourself . __eou__
 I got fired . __eou__  How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ? __eou__
 It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up . __eou__  What are you going to do now ? __eou__
 You said the same thing three months ago . __eou__  Did I ? Well . Anyway , you'll get your raise when the economy starts picking up . __eou__
 You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ? __eou__  Yes . __eou__
 Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country.But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished ! __eou__  I'm sorry , sir . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir . __eou__  It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ? __eou__
 Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess ! __eou__  I'm sorry , sir . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir . __eou__  You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault.But me--I'm the one who should be sorry.It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ? __eou__
 That's too bad . I need to discuss these plans with him . __eou__  Why don't you make an appointment for later in the week ? __eou__
 Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? __eou__  What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . __eou__
 What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . __eou__  Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway . __eou__
 Silly me . __eou__  Now press this button . __eou__
 I haven't gone to the interview yet . It's tomorrow . I am so nervous . __eou__  Don't worry . You should do fine . You have the experience . __eou__
 I ’ m a bit upset about this year ’ s bonus . I was really expecting a little more . Are there any problems with my work ? __eou__  No , not at all , Brian . This year , we ’ Ve all had to cut back . I ’ m hoping next year ’ s going to better . I hope you can understand . __eou__
 I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up . __eou__  You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now . __eou__
Listen , Christine , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . __eou__  I know , Mr . Douglas . But I am really sick . __eou__
 I know , Mr . Douglas . But I am really sick . __eou__  Well , I want a note from the doctor on this one . And , to be honest , if this continues , we may not be able to employ you here . __eou__
 Oh , Kate ! I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind ! __eou__  That ’ s okay , Martin . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I ’ d appreciate it . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , Janet . I left it at home . I ’ ll bring it back in the morning . __eou__  Mark , I told you yesterday afternoon that I would be using that file today . __eou__
 I ’ d like to know why you ’ re always taking credit for work we ’ Ve done together like that line in the new Ice Cream ad ? __eou__  That was my line , Mark . I know we worked on the ad together , but that was definitely my line . __eou__
I have to talk to you ! __eou__  What , Hilary ? I ’ m really in a hurry ! __eou__
 I know , Blake . But you ’ Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company . __eou__  I ’ Ve been busy , Hilary . We can set up a meeting to talk about the deal , but I still feel the same way . I don ’ t think it ’ s worth it . __eou__
Susan ! Why didn ’ t you tell me that you were taking over the Silk Company account ? __eou__  I thought you knew , Todd . It was decided last week . I guess you weren ’ t at the meeting . __eou__
 You know I wasn ’ t at the meeting . I was meeting with Mr . Wei about this account . I ’ Ve been on this for a month and a half . __eou__  I ’ m sorry . Todd , but Mr . Emory felt that it was going too slowly , and that it needed a fresh start . He should have told you . __eou__
 I ’ Ve got some bad news . All the plans sent over to the McGrath Corporation have been rejected . We ’ re going to have to start from scratch . __eou__  I thought they had already agreed to everything . That ’ s going to take weeks to rework . __eou__
The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! __eou__  I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy ! __eou__
 No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? __eou__  It ’ s possible . If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there . __eou__
 You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! __eou__  That ’ s the one . It seems that everyone is anxious to get to New York tonight . __eou__
 It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__  I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__
 On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . __eou__  That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__
 I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . __eou__  well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? __eou__
 I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . __eou__  can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? __eou__
 it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that , but you don't need to quit over that . Why don't you just take a leave of absence ? We can hold your job for you until your mother gets better . __eou__
 it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . __eou__  you look pretty upset . Are you ok ? __eou__
 I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . __eou__  what ’ s that ? __eou__
 I got sacked today . __eou__  you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? __eou__
I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! __eou__  don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . __eou__
 Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__  You certainly had a busy day . __eou__
 I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone . __eou__  I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ? __eou__
 I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! __eou__  Look around . __eou__
 Yeah ? __eou__  I want you to put your hands behind your head ! You are under arrest ! __eou__
 Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! __eou__  Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry ? __eou__
 It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . __eou__  I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans . __eou__
 That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! __eou__  Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom . __eou__
Excuse me . My bag was stolen , will you help me ? __eou__  When did it happen ? __eou__
Oh , sir . I lost my passport . __eou__  Do you remember when and where you last saw it ? __eou__
 Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! __eou__  Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry ? __eou__

This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom . __eou__
 My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is . __eou__  What dose she look like ? __eou__
 Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag . __eou__  Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ? __eou__
 No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about . __eou__  You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . __eou__
 I ’ d better go tomorrow . __eou__  No . But you mustn ’ t leave it too long . Did you report it the police ? __eou__
 No . I couldn ’ t find a policeman . __eou__  Well . You must report that it ’ s been stolen . And give the police description of your bag . You ’ d better go to the local police station tomorrow morning . __eou__
 Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it . __eou__  You mean it is not created by the burglar ? __eou__
 What did I do ? I haven't done anything . __eou__  You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs . __eou__
 I didn't do anything . __eou__  We've found some heroin at your house . __eou__
 No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . __eou__  That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . __eou__
 I don't need your help , jerk . __eou__  Whatever you say . __eou__
 Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can . __eou__  Did you see the car before it hit you ? __eou__
 No , I didn't . That car was too fast . __eou__  Which lane were you in ? __eou__
 Believe it or not , the company I worked for closed down , so I ’ m out of a job . __eou__  The same with me . Have you given much thought to what you want to do next ? __eou__
 Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then . __eou__  That is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment . __eou__
Well , Mr . Brooks . I ’ m sorry , again , for the delay , but we should have everything completed by the time you get back . __eou__  I certainly hope so . Can we arrange to meet on the 27th ? That should give you enough time . __eou__
John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again . __eou__  I ’ m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ’ t let it happen again . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ’ t let it happen again . __eou__  That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! __eou__
 That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! __eou__  I understand , Ms . Fairbanks . __eou__
 I don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass . __eou__  The ballot gives you all that information . __eou__
 Nobody told me that before . __eou__  You have nothing to worry about . __eou__
 You ’ re a liar ! __eou__  I ’ m not happy about it , either . __eou__
 That ’ s the dumbest thing that I ’ Ve ever heard . __eou__  I have to tell you something else that you probably won ’ t like . __eou__
 That ’ s horrible . __eou__  If you don ’ t like that , then you ’ re probably going to be mad at what I tell you next . __eou__
 I ’ m not kidding . __eou__  It ’ s a good thing I asked you . __eou__
Why am I being arrested ? __eou__  You have a warrant out for your arrest . __eou__
 I don't have a warrant . __eou__  My computer shows that you have a bench warrant . __eou__
 I don't know what a bench warrant is . __eou__  You apparently missed a court appearance . __eou__
 I was never told to go to court . __eou__  There's nothing I can do about that . __eou__
 This isn't fair . __eou__  That's life . __eou__
 What about my rights ? __eou__  Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . __eou__
I don't understand why I'm being arrested . __eou__  You have a warrant . __eou__
 A warrant for what ? __eou__  Apparently , you have a bench warrant . __eou__
 What does that mean ? __eou__  You missed a court appearance . __eou__
 I wasn't aware that I had to go to court . __eou__  I don't know what to tell you . __eou__
 I don't find this fair . __eou__  Life isn't fair . __eou__
 Don't I have any rights ? __eou__  You have the right to remain silent . __eou__
Why are you arresting me ? __eou__  There is a warrant out for your arrest . __eou__
 What kind of warrant ? __eou__  You have a bench warrant . __eou__
 What is that ? __eou__  Have you missed a court date ? __eou__
 I never went to court . __eou__  I can't help you . __eou__
 This is unfair . __eou__  A lot of things aren't fair . That's life . __eou__
 I have rights , don't I ? __eou__  You have the right to an attorney . __eou__
 No . __eou__  What's wrong ? __eou__
 I got robbed ! __eou__  By who ? __eou__
 Some guy on the street just mugged me . __eou__  Are you hurt ? __eou__
 No , he just stole all of my things . __eou__  That's crazy . __eou__
 No , I'm not . __eou__  What's going on ? __eou__
 I was just robbed ! __eou__  Are you serious ? __eou__
 Someone just robbed me . __eou__  Did he hurt you ? __eou__
 He took all my things , but he didn't hurt me . __eou__  I can't believe that . __eou__
 I need to file a complaint . __eou__  What is your complaint about ? __eou__
 I got robbed . __eou__  When did this happen ? __eou__
 I want to file a complaint . __eou__  What's the problem ? __eou__
 A man robbed me today . __eou__  When ? __eou__
 I would like to file a complaint . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 I was robbed . __eou__  When did this happen ? __eou__
 They arrested me without probable cause . __eou__  They did ? __eou__
 They had no reason for arresting me . __eou__  I thought they let you go . __eou__
 They arrested me for nothing . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me . __eou__  Didn ’ t they let you go ? __eou__
 They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning . __eou__  So they kept you at the station ? __eou__
 They sure did . __eou__  Did they tell you why they arrested you ? __eou__
 I want to take them to court for arresting me . __eou__  I don ’ t understand . __eou__
 There was no reason for them to arrest me . __eou__  They let you go , didn ’ t they ? __eou__
 They released me the next morning . __eou__  They detained you at the station ? __eou__
 That ’ s exactly what they did . __eou__  Why did they arrest you ? __eou__
 I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life . __eou__  How many of them were there ? __eou__
 Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions . __eou__  Like what ? __eou__
 Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that . __eou__  What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ? __eou__
 I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning . __eou__  Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years . __eou__
 I couldn't . I was bound and gagged . __eou__  Please tell me exactly what happened . __eou__
 Yes , I know . I regret it very much . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! __eou__  don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . __eou__
 I've lost my Traveller's Cheques , all of them . __eou__  OK , just take a deep breath , Sir . Everything is going to be fine . Here's a form to report missing Traveller's Cheques , whatever the reason . Please fill it in and we can get moving on this . __eou__
 Well . Can you tell me how much you have deposited ? __eou__  About RIB 12,000 . __eou__
 Ah , get back to you . __eou__  Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ? __eou__
I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . __eou__  It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ? __eou__
 It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . __eou__  It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way . __eou__
 I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . __eou__  Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ? __eou__
Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... __eou__  Hello , welcome to Universal Bank . Please insert your card into the slot . __eou__
 I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... __eou__  Please input your 6 digit PIN code followed by the pound key . Thank you . Please select an option.Thank you . You have selected withdrawal . __eou__
 Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just give me my money ! __eou__  Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.Thank you , you want to transfer 10000 USD to the World Wildlife Foundation . If this is correct please press 1 . __eou__
 No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! __eou__  Confirmed . Thank you for using our bank ! Please remove your card from the slot . Goodbye ! __eou__
I ’ m so frustrated ! __eou__  what ’ s wrong , Jim ? __eou__
 I've come to make sure that your stay in Beijing is a pleasant one . __eou__  Thank you so much . __eou__
 You're going out of your way for us , I believe . __eou__  You are our honored guests . __eou__
An interesting meeting , isn't it ? __eou__  Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . __eou__
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . __eou__  Let me introduce myself , by the way , my name is Dick Brown . __eou__
 Thank you very much . I ’ ll be there on time . __eou__  Excellent . I ’ ll see you on Thursday at 9 30 . __eou__
 Really ? Where did you hear that ? __eou__  I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__
 Really ? Why ? __eou__  Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go . __eou__
 Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ? __eou__  Senior director of market research . In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown . And it's an international company so I'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people . I'm really looking forward to it . __eou__
In order to extend our export business to your country , we wish to enter into direct business relations with you . __eou__  It's our pleasure . __eou__
 It's our pleasure . __eou__  Our hope is to establish mutual beneficial trading relations between us . __eou__
We have successfully fulfilled our work plan . In fact , we are No . 1 in terms of market share . __eou__  You have gotten amazing success . Congratulations ! __eou__
 You have gotten amazing success . Congratulations ! __eou__  I hope we can continue to get support from the departments concerned . __eou__
 Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! __eou__  Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! __eou__
You look very professional in the suit . __eou__  The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable . __eou__
 Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . __eou__  This time you can bring your daughter with you . __eou__
 Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . __eou__  There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . __eou__
 Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? __eou__  He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . __eou__
 Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . __eou__  I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . __eou__
Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . __eou__  Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__
 Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__  I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__
Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . __eou__  I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . __eou__

This increase includes an 80 % married increase based on your achievements and increase responsibilities and then the additional 20 % increase were reflecting the changes in cost of living . __eou__  I really appreciate it . Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__  Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__
 You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 Oh , that will be great . Thank you so much . Please help me to double-check the name list . I have to make sure they are all correct . __eou__  Ok , shall I make a coffee first ? __eou__
 Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! __eou__  Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . __eou__
 Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . __eou__  Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? __eou__
 Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . __eou__  Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__
Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . __eou__  Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . __eou__
 Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . __eou__  Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . __eou__
 Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . __eou__  I will do my best . __eou__
 No , really ? __eou__  Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__
I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . __eou__  That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__
 That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__  It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? __eou__
 Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__
 This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? __eou__  The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__

 Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__  Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . __eou__

 He's dancing with Jack ! __eou__  Gross ! __eou__
 Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing ! __eou__  Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! __eou__
 I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus ! __eou__  Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ? __eou__
 Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful . __eou__  My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him . __eou__
OK . Here's the final drawing ! It's for the trip ! __eou__  And the winner is ... Vivian , again ! I don't believe it ! __eou__
 And the winner is ... Vivian , again ! I don't believe it ! __eou__  Our red underwear didn't do any good at all ! __eou__
 Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie ! __eou__  Exactly ! With the war in Iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . __eou__
 What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? __eou__  I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! __eou__
And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . __eou__  Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__
 Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__  Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__
 Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__  No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__
 No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__  Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . __eou__
 Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . __eou__  And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__
 And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__  Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__
 Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__  Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . __eou__
 Why ? I work very hard . __eou__  Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently . And you don't work well with other employees . __eou__
 Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . __eou__  You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? __eou__
 I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! __eou__  You know the phrase the survival of the fittest . We have no choices . __eou__
 You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing . __eou__  Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ? __eou__
 Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ? __eou__  Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone . __eou__
 Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . __eou__  Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . __eou__
 Oh , really ? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ? __eou__  I don ’ t think so . As the saying goes , “ A great oak needs deep roots . ” I ’ m really interested in this job . __eou__
 I really love this kind of atmosphere . __eou__  An impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . __eou__  Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed school . __eou__
 It ’ s my pleasure . __eou__  What are your salary expectations ? __eou__
 Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute . __eou__  We should put some information about it on the home page of our university website . When people visit the website , they ’ ll see the information . __eou__
 Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet . __eou__  Which field would you like to work in ? have you decide yet ? __eou__
 How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . __eou__  That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ? __eou__
 Good ! Here , let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it . __eou__  That will be very nice . You're too kind . __eou__
 That will be very nice . You're too kind . __eou__  I've already made a hotel reservation for you , let's go to the hotel first and drop off your things .

 Thank you very much . __eou__  My pleasure , I hope your visit to Beijing is very enjoyable ! __eou__
 What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it . __eou__  Didn't you get the memo ? __eou__
 Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__
 Thanks , Vivian . __eou__  No problem at all . Welcome . __eou__
Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . __eou__  I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . __eou__
 I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . __eou__  This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . __eou__
 This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . __eou__  Thank you , I will be doing my best . __eou__
 Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? __eou__  I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-step research before I send my application letters out . __eou__
Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . __eou__  Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__
 Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__  I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__

 It ’ s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory . __eou__  Let us know when you are free . We ’ ll arrange the tour for you . __eou__
 Really ? I thought I was doing well . __eou__  Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again ! __eou__  Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . __eou__
 Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . __eou__  After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? __eou__
 What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? __eou__  Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . __eou__
 Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! __eou__  Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . __eou__
 Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . __eou__  Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . __eou__
I've got some great news for you ! __eou__  Did you get the position you wanted ? __eou__
 Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . __eou__  I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! __eou__
 I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! __eou__  Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . __eou__
 Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . __eou__  Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it ! __eou__
 Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it ! __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . __eou__  Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . __eou__
 Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . __eou__  You've earned it . __eou__
 Good news for us . When can you start to work ? __eou__  It ’ s my honor to be one member of your company . I ’ d like to begin to work any time as you like . __eou__
 Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ? __eou__  Retirement age is still 65 , but I think more and more people are retiring earlier , I think Bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young . __eou__
 What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? __eou__  I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... __eou__
 Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? __eou__  There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on . __eou__
 Are you kidding ? __eou__  No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... __eou__
 You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . __eou__  But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__
 Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! __eou__  Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . __eou__
 Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . __eou__  Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . __eou__
 Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . __eou__  Really ? What could that be ? __eou__
 Really ? What could that be ? __eou__  Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . __eou__
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this . __eou__  Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so . __eou__
 Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! __eou__  That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . __eou__
 Jessica , I am very sorry to hear that . Why are you leaving ? __eou__  I've been offered another job with higher salary . And it also gives me the opportunity of promotion . __eou__
 Oh , yeah ? __eou__  Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . __eou__
 Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! __eou__  Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! __eou__
Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! __eou__  No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__
 Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ... __eou__  That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__
 Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__  Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__
 I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday . __eou__  You are welcome , Mr . Sun . __eou__
 You are welcome , Mr . Sun . __eou__  I really enjoyed meeting with you . __eou__

 You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability . __eou__  Is there anything I should do ? __eou__
 Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? __eou__  Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable.Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! __eou__
 Thank you , Mrs Smith . It is really a pleasure talking with you . __eou__  The same for me . We'll keep in touch with you . __eou__
 The same for me . We'll keep in touch with you . __eou__  Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
 Oh , no . What did I do ? It ’ s asking me for a password . __eou__  Don ’ t worry . See where it says , “ New User ” ? __eou__
 Oh no ! That ’ s terrible ! __eou__  Yeah . __eou__
 Well , thank you very much , Mr . Sun . I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible . Goodbye . __eou__  Thank you , Mrs . Smith . I do hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . __eou__
 That would be great ! I hate working with computers ! __eou__  Year ! They are unreliable sometimes . __eou__
 Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people . __eou__  Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments . __eou__
 Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments . __eou__  Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ’ Ve got some idea of your exports . I ’ m interested in your silk blouses . __eou__
 Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ’ Ve got some idea of your exports . I ’ m interested in your silk blouses . __eou__  Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ’ Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand . __eou__
 Nice to see you , Mrs . Anderson . __eou__  Nice to see you too , Mr . Brown . Won ’ t you sit down ? __eou__
 Nice to see you too , Mr . Brown . Won ’ t you sit down ? __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 That sounds interesting . I ’ ll send a fax home . As soon as I receive a definite answer , I ’ ll make a specific inquiry . __eou__  We ’ ll then make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be conducted between us . __eou__
 We ’ ll then make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be conducted between us . __eou__  So do I . __eou__
 Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York . __eou__  Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you . __eou__
 Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you . __eou__  How are you getting along with your business ? __eou__
 How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ? __eou__  It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up . __eou__
 I see . Well , thank you very much for helping me . You have been very helpful . __eou__  If you have any further questions , you can call any time . __eou__
This facility is great , don't you think ? __eou__  Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . __eou__
 Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . __eou__  I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . __eou__
 Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? __eou__  No . __eou__
 Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango . __eou__  That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site . __eou__
 Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . __eou__  I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . " __eou__
 Really ? How come ? __eou__  My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult ! __eou__
This is a very good meeting , Liz . __eou__  I am happy that we ’ Ve finally cleared up some problems . __eou__
 I am happy that we ’ Ve finally cleared up some problems . __eou__  I think we have . Is there anything else to discuss ? __eou__
 Great . Thanks so much for your time . __eou__  We'll contact you soon , Tom . Thanks for coming in . __eou__
 well , I think you'd be the perfect candidate for the position . According to company policy , you'll still have to go through the formal application procedures though , so fill this application form in __eou__  ok . Thanks for your support . __eou__
 Oh , yes , Mr Wang , i look at your resume you emailed , very impressive , are you a P . M . ~ meet someone like you , i was thinking of calling you this afternoon , and having a telephone interview . __eou__  That is wonderful . __eou__
 Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . __eou__  Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job . __eou__
 Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job . __eou__  Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker ! __eou__
 Yeah ? All right . Thanks , Susan . __eou__  That ’ s all right . __eou__
 It ’ s Alex ... Have I got some great news ! We got the Baker account . It ’ s all ours ! __eou__  Fantastic ! I can ’ t believe it ! That ’ s the biggest account we ’ Ve gotten so far ! __eou__
 What , Hilary ? I ’ m really in a hurry ! __eou__  I know , Blake . But you ’ Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company . __eou__
 Better than ever ! You won ’ t have to worry about “ finding ” extra money for me anymore ! We made nearly a quarter of million in profit last year ! __eou__  Congratulations ! I ’ m really glad to hear it ! That should make balancing the books a lot easier ! __eou__
 Alex . It ’ s Nancy over in Marketing . I ’ Ve got some good news for you . __eou__  Oh yeah ? I could use some . What ’ s up ? __eou__
 Oh yeah ? I could use some . What ’ s up ? __eou__  Mr . Morris was so pleased with your sales work on his account that he went straight to the top with it . He wrote a letter about it to Mr . Macmillan ! __eou__
 Fantastic ! I got the promotion ! __eou__  Great ! When do you take over ? __eou__
 Great ! When do you take over ? __eou__  After the new year . __eou__
 Wrong number ? Are you sure ? I called yesterday and she was there . __eou__  I'm sure you have the wrong number . This one has been my number for more than 20 years . __eou__
 Really ? I ' m so sorry I bothered you . I ' ll try again . __eou__  That's all right . This sort of thing happens all the time to everyone . __eou__
 Great . I will make my reservations as necessary . __eou__  Just make sure to turn in all the necessary paperwork to ensure there are no problems with the days you want to take off . __eou__
 So you ’ Ve acquainted yourself with the company . It ’ s refreshing to interview someone who ’ s sure of what they want . __eou__  Yes , I believe that it ’ s crucial for me to know if a company is right for me , not just if I ’ m right for the company . I ’ Ve only been impressed by what I ’ Ve read and heard and I see myself having __eou__
 Definitely ! Very relaxing . __eou__  Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__
 What ? I only stayed three nights . __eou__  That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__
 I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? __eou__  The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . __eou__
 That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ? __eou__  Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ? __eou__
 You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ? __eou__  Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number . __eou__
 Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully . __eou__  I ’ Ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it ’ s really no big deal . __eou__
 really ? I didn't know that would be possible . __eou__  sure , we'd be carry to lose a good worker like you . __eou__
 you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? __eou__  well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week . __eou__
 really ? Why ? __eou__  it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . __eou__
 but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! __eou__  well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . __eou__
 well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? __eou__  the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . __eou__
 of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally . __eou__  thanks . I appreciate that . __eou__
 it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit . __eou__  that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager . __eou__
 really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ? __eou__  I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs . __eou__
 it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming ! __eou__  that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ? __eou__
 that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ? __eou__  our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . __eou__
 well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow ! __eou__  thanks ! __eou__
 really ? what is it ? __eou__  it's a job at a recruitment agency . __eou__
 great ! __eou__  well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners __eou__
 Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever . __eou__  thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? __eou__
 really ? Why ? __eou__  I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . __eou__
 congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing . __eou__  thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ? __eou__
 Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . __eou__  That sounds ideal . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . __eou__  Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . __eou__
 553-2213 . Great , thanks . __eou__  No problem . Pick me up something to eat too , please . __eou__
 Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . __eou__  Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? __eou__
 Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? __eou__  No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? __eou__
 Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? __eou__  I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? __eou__
 No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . __eou__  It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . __eou__
 Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . __eou__
 Some what ? __eou__  Weed ! You know ? Pot , Ganja , Mary Jane some chronic ! __eou__
 That was easy ! __eou__  Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on . __eou__
 What ? Huh ? __eou__  So after you noted the hours , starting at zero which is midnight , you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes . Get it ? __eou__
 Huh ? What ? __eou__  Just make sure you show your total , sign it , and turn it in . __eou__
I am sorry I am so late to work . __eou__  What was the problem ? __eou__
 I lost track of time . __eou__  Things happen ; make sure it doesn't become a habit . __eou__
 We have a really interesting project coming up . Would you want to join us on it ? __eou__  I'm not sure . Let me think about it . __eou__
 I have a special assignment coming up . Would you be interested in helping me on it ? __eou__  I'd like to , but I am very busy . __eou__
 Well , we have some special projects coming up . Would you be interested in working on any of those ? __eou__  Yes , I would love to work on a special project ! __eou__
 Yes , I would love to work on a special project ! __eou__  Well then , I'll keep you in the loop . Thank you for your help today . __eou__
 When you finish completing the request form , we will order and let you know when the supplies are here . Have a great day ! __eou__  Good-bye ! __eou__
 Well , just finish the request and we will contact you when the supplies come in . Have a good day ! __eou__  You too ! __eou__
 Fine , well just send the form to us and we will let you know as soon as your supplies come in . Have a good day ! __eou__  Thank you ! __eou__
 Great ! Thanks a lot ! __eou__  No problem , John . __eou__
 Great ! That ’ ll be ahead of schedule ! Good work . __eou__  Well , as the saying goes – we aim to please ! __eou__
 I read about that , and the position sounded great ! __eou__  Let ’ s go see how we can apply for those positions . __eou__
 You know , I saw that and it looks pretty good ! __eou__  Let ’ s go check it out again ! __eou__
 I think I forgot to send it in ! __eou__  You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid . __eou__
 Yes , sir . That ’ s more than enough time . I do appreciate your understanding . Why don ’ t we say 10:00 o ’ clock on the 27th ? __eou__  Fine , Mr . Tan . I ’ ll see you then . __eou__
 Yeah ? What does he want ? __eou__  He needs to see the two of us to talk about next week ’ s annual sales meeting . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes . I was right there . __eou__
 I can't believe it . __eou__  I was really scared when he pulled the gun out . __eou__
 Oh , really ? __eou__  Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign . __eou__
 Oh , you do ? __eou__  I am volunteering for the campaign . __eou__
 That ’ s wonderful . Thank you . __eou__  Can I see your ID , please ? __eou__
 No problem . My husband bought me some beautiful jewellery for our anniversary and I don't feel safe keeping it in the house . Initially , on the advice of a friend , I stored it in the freezer . __eou__  What a lovely gift . Yes , I can understand why you wouldn't be comfortable keeping something so valuable at home . I think one of our small ones will be perfect . Do you have some ID with you ? __eou__
 What a lovely gift . Yes , I can understand why you wouldn't be comfortable keeping something so valuable at home . I think one of our small ones will be perfect . Do you have some ID with you ? __eou__  Yes , right here . So , we can do this today , then ? That will definitely ease my mind . __eou__
 That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help . __eou__  If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance , we can do that for you today , there is no need to wait . __eou__
 Well , congratulations ! It's lovely being a newly wed , but also so much pressure . Could you tell me what kind of property you are looking for ? __eou__  Yes , just a simple apartment , nothing too big . __eou__
 So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan . __eou__  It's our pleasure . We are always happy to have another satisfied customer . Thanks for calling . Goodbye . __eou__
 The list goes on and on ! __eou__  Yes , it sure does . And with our new premises , we have new services . We can provide 24 - hour support for your Wealth Management . __eou__
 I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? __eou__  Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu . __eou__
 Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? __eou__  What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . __eou__
 Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . __eou__  Have you invested in the stock market before ? __eou__
 No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . __eou__  But that is a little risky , you know . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . __eou__
 Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . __eou__  10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country . __eou__
 What perfect timing ! __eou__  Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ? __eou__
 No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! __eou__  You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? __eou__
 Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ? __eou__  Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! __eou__
 Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! __eou__  That's the opinion of most people . Do you have your passport with you ? I'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form . __eou__
 A specialist ? That's excellent , thanks . __eou__  No problem , Sir . He'll be with you in just a minute . Could I get you something to drink while you are waiting ? __eou__
 That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . __eou__  With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . __eou__
 With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . __eou__  That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself . __eou__
 That ’ s great . __eou__  May I see your ID ? __eou__
 That ’ s good to know . __eou__  Congratulations on your first voting day . __eou__
 Thanks for telling me . __eou__  You should be excited about your first vote . __eou__
 Are you serious ? __eou__  I ’ m not sure what I ’ m doing . __eou__
 I ’ m so glad you told me that . __eou__  Good luck on your first election . __eou__
I am really excited ! __eou__  Why are you so excited ? __eou__
 Why ? __eou__  You turned 18 a month before the election . __eou__
 Are you serious ? __eou__  Seriously , but I ’ m excited that I did . __eou__
 I ’ m shocked he actually won . __eou__  I knew he would win . __eou__
I am so excited ! __eou__  Excited about what ? __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  No , but that makes me even more excited . __eou__
Can you tell that I ’ m excited ? __eou__  What are you excited about ? __eou__
 You didn ’ t ? __eou__  I really didn ’ t , but I ’ m still excited . __eou__
 I didn ’ t expect him to win . __eou__  I had no doubt in my mind that he would win . __eou__
 Can you believe that he actually won ? __eou__  I knew he would win . __eou__
 I didn ’ t think he would . __eou__  He was the top candidate . __eou__
 That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . __eou__  We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly . __eou__
 How did you do that ? __eou__  I mailed in an absentee ballot . __eou__
 Fabulous . Thanks . __eou__  Do you have ID ? __eou__
 What do you mean you already voted ? __eou__  I had to mail in an absentee ballot . __eou__
Can you believe that Obama is our new President ? __eou__  I ’ m so happy about that . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe that Obama won . __eou__  I couldn ’ t be happier to know that he ’ s our new President . __eou__
 I couldn ’ t be happier to know that he ’ s our new President . __eou__  I know ! He just made history ! __eou__
 I am so happy that he is our new President ! __eou__  So am I . __eou__
 So am I . __eou__  I hope that he brings change to America . __eou__
I can ’ t believe Obama is our President . __eou__  I am proud to know that he is our President . __eou__
Can you believe that Obama was actually elected ? __eou__  I can believe it , and I am very excited about it . __eou__
 I can believe it , and I am very excited about it . __eou__  I hope you voted for him . __eou__
 I really like you . __eou__  I really appreciate that . __eou__
 How is it you don ’ t know ? __eou__  The location of my polling place never came in the mail . __eou__
 I ’ m still shocked that Obama was elected . __eou__  I couldn ’ t believe it , either . __eou__
 I couldn ’ t believe it , either . __eou__  He just made history . __eou__
 Yeah . I am so excited that Obama won . __eou__  I ’ m so happy that he did . __eou__
 I ’ m so happy that he did . __eou__  That man just made history . __eou__
 You should know that already . __eou__  I didn ’ t receive my polling place in the mail . __eou__
 How come you don ’ t know where it is ? __eou__  Nothing came in the mail telling me my polling place . __eou__
 It ’ s a fun job . __eou__  They don ’ t pay a lot , do they ? __eou__
 It ’ s a very cool job . __eou__  Do they pay you a lot ? __eou__
 What ? You can ’ t be serious ! __eou__  I was just as shocked when I found out . __eou__
 That ’ s right . Plus , I agree with his policies . __eou__  I ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited . __eou__
 I ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited . __eou__  I ’ m voting for the next President . __eou__
 I ’ m voting for the next President . __eou__  I ’ m sure he will be . __eou__
 I ’ m sure he will be . __eou__  I ’ m going to make sure and vote . __eou__
 That can ’ t be true ! __eou__  I ’ m upset , too . __eou__
 I ’ m excited to speak to a candidate . __eou__  What would you like to ask me ? __eou__
 I like that . __eou__  I hope so . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe I ’ m actually speaking to a candidate . __eou__  You can ask me questions , if you ’ d like . __eou__
 I think that is really cool of you . __eou__  I ’ m glad to hear that . __eou__
 Yes , I am , and I am so excited . __eou__  Have you figured out who you ’ re going to vote for ? __eou__
 I love my candidate . __eou__  Why is that ? __eou__
 My candidate is probably the most intelligent . __eou__  Is that right ? __eou__
 I also agree with all his policies . __eou__  That ’ s great ! __eou__
 That ’ s great ! __eou__  I know he ’ s going to be the next President . __eou__
 I know he ’ s going to be the next President . __eou__  Hopefully , he will be . __eou__
 Hopefully , he will be . __eou__  I can ’ t wait to vote . __eou__
 I am so excited to be voting . __eou__  Do you know who you ’ re going to vote for ? __eou__
 I am so impressed with the candidate I ’ m going to vote for . __eou__  What ’ s so great about him ? __eou__
 What ’ s so great about him ? __eou__  I feel that he is very intelligent . __eou__
 I feel that he is very intelligent . __eou__  Oh , really ? __eou__
 Oh , really ? __eou__  Yes , and I agree with all his policies . __eou__
 Yes , and I agree with all his policies . __eou__  That ’ s good to hear . __eou__
 That ’ s good to hear . __eou__  I think this man is going to be the next President . __eou__
 Are you serious ? __eou__  I ’ m not kidding . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes , I ’ m serious . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe you didn ’ t know when the elections were . __eou__  It slipped my mind . __eou__
 You can ’ t be serious . __eou__  Why would I joke ? __eou__
 Thank you very much for your cooperation . __eou__  I'm glad to help . __eou__
 Are you serious ? __eou__  I was there . __eou__
 Your cooperation is very much appreciated . __eou__  I'm happy to be of assistance . __eou__
 Are you serious ? __eou__  When he pulled out the gun , I got so scared . __eou__
 That's crazy . __eou__  I need to go to the police station . __eou__
 I can't believe that . __eou__  I need to make a statement at the police station . __eou__
 Not at all . __eou__  What's the problem ? __eou__
 Someone just robbed me . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 This guy just robbed me right on the street . __eou__  He didn't hurt you , did he ? __eou__
 I'm okay . He just stole my things . __eou__  I'm so sorry . __eou__
 I have to go to court ? __eou__  That's right . __eou__
 Really ? I'm sorry . I did not know that . __eou__  I'm going to give you a ticket . __eou__
 I have to be at court ? __eou__  Of course . __eou__
 I have to go to court over a brake light ? __eou__  That's how it works . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe it . __eou__  What are your plans ? __eou__
 I ’ m so excited . __eou__  What are you planning on doing now ? __eou__
 That's crazy . __eou__  The news reported that four stores were broken into . __eou__
 Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ’ t you ? __eou__  Yes . I was . But I didn ’ t have enough time to devote to it . __eou__
 I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . __eou__  I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! __eou__
 Oh , really ? Do you know which company it's from ? __eou__  Yes , it's from Satura Beds of Tokyo . __eou__
 I can help you with that . Holiday , you say ? Lucky you ! Where are you going to be travelling to ? __eou__  We are going to Macau to visit my niece . She said it's better for me to bring US dollars , is that right ? __eou__
 Great ! Do you need me to sign anything ? __eou__  Yes . Please sign your name at the bottom of the Exchange Receipt . Thanks very much and here's your money . __eou__
 I'd like to make a deposit please , into my granddaughter's account . It's her birthday on Friday . __eou__  What a thoughtful granddad ! Do you have her account details with you ? __eou__
 What a thoughtful granddad ! Do you have her account details with you ? __eou__  Yes , right here . __eou__
 Not just a thoughtful granddad , but a generous one too . __eou__  It's an important birthday . __eou__
 7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ? __eou__  If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours . __eou__
 Haha ! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars . __eou__  Yes , I guess you are right . So , do you need my passport ? __eou__
 Thanks , Mr Janus . Of course I trust you , but regulations are regulations . __eou__  Here you go . __eou__
 That's a relief ! I was a little worried about it ; I left England in a bit of a hurry . __eou__  How much would you like to change ? __eou__
Hey , Mr Brown . How are you ? Look at that smile on your face ! __eou__  Recently it's been pretty good , actually . __eou__
 Recently it's been pretty good , actually . __eou__  That's what we like to hear , a profitable business . __eou__
 That's what we like to hear , a profitable business . __eou__  Well , yes . Thanks , there's no trouble at the moment . __eou__
 Well , yes . Thanks , there's no trouble at the moment . __eou__  So , what can I do for you today ? Are you needing to withdraw or transfer ? __eou__
 Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system . __eou__  Right , so the deposit , if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification ? __eou__
 Yes , I recalled you charging that before . And I thought it was extortionate ! Haha ! __eou__  I can just take it from your account , you don't need to give me cash . __eou__
 Hello . My aunt in the US has sent me $ 500 . She sent it yesterday , using the standard service . It's my birthday today , you see . __eou__  Well , happy birthday . If it was sent yesterday using the usual service , it should be here already . You do have an account with us , right ? __eou__
 That sounds great . More dividends if I want to purchase them ! __eou__  There are two different types that we are offering at the moment , Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . __eou__
 You remember me ! Yes , I'm with Li Wang Enterprises ; I'm the Accountant Peters . __eou__  Yes , of course , Mr Peters ! Good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? __eou__
 Yes , of course , Mr Peters ! Good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? __eou__  Well , we've just acquired a new business so we need to set up a lot of services with you . We are particularly interested in Agent Services . __eou__
 Thank goodness . It is still there . Thank you very much . __eou__  It's my pleasure . Please fill out this lost passbook bill and list the code word you used when you first opened your account . __eou__
 Oh dear ! Where should I go from here ? __eou__  I'd recommend going back to the 3rd party , personally this time , and discussing what exactly it is they aren't happy with . Hopefully you can reach some sort of agreement , which is viable for everyone . __eou__
 Oh , really ? Do you know which company they are from ? __eou__  They're from Schnitt's of Rudesheim , Germany . Would you like us to check them ? __eou__
 Really ? Have you checked everything carefully ? __eou__  Very carefully , that's when I found the problem . __eou__
 That's what I want ! Do you need me to sign anything ? Or fill in some forms ? __eou__  Just sign right here , please . That's everything you need to do . __eou__
 That's so simple . I'll come by my local branch later this afternoon and get it set up . Thank you very much , Tina . __eou__  It's a pleasure . Thanks for calling Lincoln Bank . __eou__
 Really ? In that case , could I have the number of the Service Centre please ? __eou__  Of course . It's 33234 . That will put you in touch with a Personal Banker . __eou__
 That is good news . __eou__  Shall I go ahead and process them for you ? __eou__
 You're right , no problems . You are becoming quite the expert , Mr Lawson . If any problem does turn up , which I'm sure it won't , I'll give you a call . __eou__  Thanks very much . I'm sure I'll be back , so see you again soon . Bye ! __eou__
 That's great ! That was quick , after it not being there yesterday I wasn't expecting to hear from you for a while . __eou__  Well , it's here now . Shall we credit that straight to your account ? __eou__
 OK . Thank you for your help . That's very nice of you . __eou__  It's my pleasure . __eou__
 That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James ! __eou__  Bye ! __eou__
 Yes , please . Thank you very much . __eou__  It'll be great to have you again . __eou__
 It'll be great to have you again . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? __eou__  Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . __eou__
 Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ? __eou__  We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__
 Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . __eou__  But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . __eou__
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep . __eou__  I promise . __eou__
 Certainly , that's easy . We will work out our CIF offer this evening . Could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 AM ? __eou__  Okay , see you tomorrow ! __eou__
 We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__  I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__
 I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__  Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__
 Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__
 Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . __eou__  Do you sell direct to shops ? __eou__
 We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face . __eou__  I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . __eou__
 Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR . __eou__  Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift . __eou__
 Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift . __eou__  Or a curse . __eou__
 Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__  Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__
 Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__  I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . __eou__
 $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! __eou__  It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light .

Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? __eou__  I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__
 I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__  I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__
 I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__  Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__
 Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__  But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__

 Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__  I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__
 I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__  That ’ s a little complicated .

Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__
 That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__  Really ? __eou__
 Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__  Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__

 Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . __eou__  How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__
 That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__  So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__
 So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__  Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . __eou__

I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . __eou__  Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U .
