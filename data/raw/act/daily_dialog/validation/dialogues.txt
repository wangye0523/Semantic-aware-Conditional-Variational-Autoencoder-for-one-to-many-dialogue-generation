 Got it , sir . It'd be great to see you again , sir . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Excuse me , sir . This is your passport . __eou__
 OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try . __eou__  Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ? __eou__
 I am not used to wearing that . Thanks . __eou__  If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time , you'll feel more comfortable . So please try to sleep , and have meals according to Los Angeles's time . __eou__
 Yes , but you look fine . __eou__  Oh , it's for my brother . The little boy over there . He is getting a carsickness . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but everything is taken . __eou__  How about the next flight-tomorrow at two o'clock ? __eou__
 We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates . __eou__  What's the difference ? __eou__
 You can be sure of that , sir . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Where are you coming from ? __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry , but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United States , so I wasn't sure what to put . __eou__  You must specify an address of the place where you will spend most of your time . __eou__
 I think something in the countryside would be nice . __eou__  Perfect ! This package includes round-trip flights to New Hampshire . A free airport pick-up is included . Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften the thirty-minute ride to the countryside . __eou__
 Yes , it's $ 167 . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 That ’ s not bad . Thanks for your help . __eou__  It ’ s my pleasure , Madam . __eou__
 Yes , we can , but it isn ’ t very interesting . __eou__  Then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path . __eou__
 Thank you very much . I look forward to seeing you on Friday . __eou__  Could I just take your credit card number please ? I should mention that there is a cancellation charge of $ 20 . __eou__
 Yes , here you go . __eou__  Will you be checking any bags today . __eou__
 What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd ! __eou__  I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . __eou__
 The train aren ’ t usually full . We can get them on the day we travel . We should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles . __eou__  We should take a packed lunch on the journey . The food they sell on the trains is always expensive . __eou__
 But we ’ Ve only been on the road for ten minutes . __eou__  I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left . __eou__
 And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train . __eou__  Which is more expensive ? __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Will you please put your luggage on the scale ? __eou__
 NO.You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Never mind , come right in . I've almost finished.You always keep the room neat and tidy , I must say.It saves me a lot of work , but you should let me do it . __eou__  It doesn't take much time . I ' m used to tidying up my room myself . __eou__
 This room has two double beds.It ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.It ' s quite a comfortable room . __eou__  How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight.We ' re going to continue our trip in the morning . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Thank you , sir.Enjoy your stay with us . __eou__
 Sorry.You have to buy your ticket at the next counter . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Just a minute , please.It ' s in my bag.Here it is . __eou__  Thank you.Please fill out the Baggage Declaration Form . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection . __eou__
 I've paid for it . Here's the receipt . __eou__  Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America . __eou__
 Yes , here you are . __eou__  Thank you . What's your occupation , Mr . Smith ? __eou__
 George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent . __eou__  Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much . __eou__
 Sure , here you are . And here are my application forms as well . __eou__  Thank you miss ... Wang . I'm Bob Jones and I'll be handling your application . __eou__
 Really ? I'm in a hurry.All right . __eou__  Ah , a set of keys . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Will you please put your luggage on the scale ? __eou__
 I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself . __eou__  Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight.You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage . __eou__
 I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight . __eou__  No , exactly not __eou__
 No , exactly not __eou__  How about afternoon ? __eou__
 Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency . __eou__  Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . __eou__
 That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . __eou__  Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . __eou__
 Yes , here you are . __eou__  Thank you.What ' s your occupation , Mr . Smith ? __eou__
 Oh , thank you very much . __eou__  Please hold the line . I ’ ll see if there is a duplex suite available on that day . ( a minute later ) Sir ? Holiday Inn is available for your need . __eou__
 That's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . __eou__  Thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? __eou__
 Ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip . __eou__  Yes ! __eou__
 I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . __eou__  Oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? __eou__
 We should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air . __eou__  Wonderful ! I think that's a great idea How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! __eou__
 Perfect . I'II start preparing tomorrow . If we re going to drive , l'II need to fill up the tank . __eou__  No need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . __eou__
 No problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . __eou__  Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to with us . __eou__
 Thanks . Dad , but I can manage it myself . __eou__  Make sure you have your ID card . You will need it while you travel . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  Where ? __eou__
 Right . Thanks . __eou__  Here are your baggage claim stubs , miss . And here are your boarding passes . Your seats are 29K and 29J . Your flight leaves at Gate 7 , and we'll be boarding in about an hour and a half . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  Have a nice flight . __eou__
 Yes , I know . I must get my traveler's check and some foreign currency . __eou__  Yes , you need the traveler's check but you needn't get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don't need them . __eou__
 Really ? That's very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . __eou__  You needn't buy one . You can have mine . __eou__
 That's very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don't mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . __eou__  Don't be silly , John . I'm going with you . It's necessary for me to have a holiday too . __eou__
 Really ? Maybe I ’ ll do that then . __eou__  Ok well , you let me know your schedule and I ’ ll book a ticket for you . __eou__
 Certainly . May I have your name , please ? __eou__  My name is Tom Smith . __eou__
 Ok , I ’ ll take it . __eou__  Thank you , sir . May I have your name and phone number , please ? __eou__
 Ok . I ’ ll send a check . __eou__  Could you tell me your name , address and phone number , please ? __eou__
 All right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . __eou__  Thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  Now let's have one together . __eou__
 Let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . __eou__  OK , let's have a try . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  Then just press the black button all the way down . __eou__
 That's so kind of you . Thank you very much ! __eou__  You're welcome . Now smile ... __eou__
 Here you go . __eou__  48C . It's on your left hand side . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Please fasten your seat belt , miss . __eou__
 Oops ! I forgot . __eou__  Also , please place your carry-on luggage either under your seat or in the overhead compartment . __eou__
 It doesn't take much time . I'm used to tidying up my room myself . __eou__  It's very considerate of you to do so . Do you have any laundry today ? __eou__
 Let me see . Yes , you can have Room 313 . It's at the back . __eou__  What's the price per day ' ? And are the meals included or extra ? __eou__
 OK . __eou__  Thank you . The porter will show you to your room __eou__
 Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary . __eou__  I'm Frank . Nice to meet you . __eou__
 This room has two double beds . It's number 56 at the rear of the motel . It's quite a comfortable room . __eou__  How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight . We're going to continue our trip in the morning . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Thank you , sir . Enjoy your stay with us . __eou__
 Good choice ! __eou__  What kind of drinks do you have ? __eou__
 Sure . Anything else ? __eou__  Yes . There is one more thing . __eou__
 Go ahead , please . __eou__  The mini bar door was open when I checked in . I didn ’ t use it . Could you send someone to check it out ? __eou__
 We ’ ll send someone right up . But don ’ t worry about that . Maybe the service person forgot to do it . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 You ’ re right . __eou__  Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ? __eou__
 Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you . __eou__  Oh , thank you kindly . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Will you please put all your luggage on the scale ? __eou__
 Okay . I ’ ll have them brought to your room right away . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Yes , here you are . __eou__  Thank you . W hat's your occupation , Mr . Smith ? __eou__
 Just a minute , please . It's in my bag . Here it is . __eou__  Thank you . Please fill out the Baggage Declaration Form . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection . __eou__
 Ok . __eou__  You can buy credit on the hotel website or at the business centre . __eou__
 Could you ? Thank you . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . What brings you to China ? __eou__
 That ’ s fine . __eou__  But , ladies , the room ’ s not yet ready . It will be delay about half an hour . Perhaps you can fill the registration form first . And rest at the lobby for a while . We ’ ll let you know when the room ‘ s ready . __eou__
 Alright . thanks . __eou__  Ladies , Hotel policy requires one nine of room charge as deposit . __eou__
 Yes , I have . Here are my blouse , coats and stockings . __eou__  Anything else ? __eou__
 There are a few spots on it . I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . Dry-cleaning usually takes three days . __eou__  Oh , no . I also need this tomorrow evening . __eou__
 Oh , no . I also need this tomorrow evening . __eou__  In that case , I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment , and have it well pressed . You might get it back on time then . __eou__
 That's a good idea . __eou__  By the way , a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday . __eou__
 Yes , I noticed it yet . __eou__  The laundry has sewed on a new button for you . __eou__
 Oh , thanks a lot . __eou__  I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others . __eou__
 This room 117 , and we have just checked in . __eou__  Yes ? __eou__
 Sure , here they are . __eou__  Any luggage ? __eou__
 No problem . I'll give you an aisle seat in the center row . And here is your ticket , passport and boarding pass . Please board the plane at Gate 15 . __eou__  Thank you . And when is the latest time for me to board the plane ? __eou__
 I think you will find it quiet . It faces the courtyard . __eou__  What is the rate , please ? __eou__
 We do serve dinner . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed.we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car . __eou__  Did you get the camera ? __eou__
 But we ’ Ve only been on the road for ten minutes . __eou__  I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left . __eou__
 Yes , I see . five thirty AM Mr . Green , Room 1021 . __eou__  I want to change my wake-up time . __eou__
 Tim , in Room 1021 . __eou__  And when would you want us call you this time ? __eou__
 That ’ s exactly when I ’ ll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . __eou__  Tell you what , I ’ ll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I ’ ll mention it to him then . __eou__
 Thank you . It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly . __eou__  When I deleted the $ 10 , the computer automatically added a $ 2 service charge . __eou__
 Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ? __eou__  Sir , if it makes you feel any better , the $ 2 service fee used to be $ 5 . __eou__
 That's a good idea , except I want to go out , not stay in . Something else , maybe ? __eou__  Well , how about Gramercy Tavern ? It's a very popular tourist spot , with great food and music . __eou__
 That's too bad , but the porterhouse will be okay . __eou__  May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? __eou__
 Not tonight , thank you . __eou__  No strawberries . We'll charge your amenities account , if that's okay . __eou__
 Go ahead . I'm all ears . __eou__  We have a computer lab on the first floor . __eou__
 Oh , no filet ? Okay , porterhouse will be fine then . __eou__  Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? __eou__
 Not tonight , but thank you for the suggestion . __eou__  Okay . This will be charged to your amenities account , okay ? __eou__
 Sure , I love porterhouse , too . __eou__  Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? __eou__
 I'd love to , but I'm allergic to strawberries . __eou__  Okay , no strawberries tonight . The items will be charged to your amenities account . __eou__
 Uh-oh ! I can't use Ethernet . My computer is wireless only . __eou__  That's okay . I can tell you about some alternatives we have . __eou__
 Any alternative that works will be great . __eou__  Well , there's our computer lab on the first floor . __eou__
 That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port . Unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only . __eou__  In that case , let me tell you about some alternatives . __eou__
 Anything to get me up and running . __eou__  For starters , we have a computer lab . __eou__
 Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . We're set up for wireless right here . __eou__  Great ! I like that suggestion , but what if I need to print something there ? __eou__
 Well , I prefer filet , but porterhouse is good , too . __eou__  Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? __eou__
 Just the champagne will be fine , thank you . __eou__  You'll see this charge on your amenities account . __eou__
 Well , I see the cable . But my computer runs on wireless only . __eou__  No problem . I'll tell you about our alternatives . __eou__
 Yes , I'd love to hear what the alternatives are . __eou__  Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor . __eou__
 Just use your computer here in the lobby . It's set up for wireless . __eou__  Okay . That sounds like a winner . Now if I need to print something in the lobby ? __eou__
 I'd prefer the filet , but the porterhouse will do . __eou__  And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? __eou__
 Normally , I would take you up on that suggestion , but just the champagne will do for tonight . __eou__  Okay , no strawberries . Room service will be charged to your amenities account . Is that all right ? __eou__
 Sure ! Right now , I would even eat hamburger ! __eou__  Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne ? __eou__
 Thank you , but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries . __eou__  That'll be a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and porterhouse , all charged to your amenities account . __eou__
 Oh , no ! I've got all I need for my stay here . __eou__  So , what's the problem ? __eou__
 That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value . __eou__  I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly . __eou__
 No , I still have plenty left , even if I took three baths a day . __eou__  I'm more confused now than before . How is there a problem ? __eou__
 Are you kidding ? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs ? __eou__  No problem at all , sir . Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand . __eou__  I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo . __eou__
 Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs . __eou__  I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment . __eou__
 I'm not sure I'm following you , sir . __eou__  Specifically , I'm talking about the little things , like soap and shampoo . __eou__
 I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life , and I don't intend to start now . __eou__  Sir , housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily . __eou__
 Oh , that's not the same . I never pay for hotel souvenirs ! __eou__  I'll call housekeeping . Someone will be up with more amenities shortly . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  I hope you enjoyed your stay , sir . __eou__
 And thanks to you . __eou__  I hope you'll visit us again , sir . __eou__
 I'd be willing to try this hotel again , if you can promise me no more cockroaches . __eou__  I guarantee you that our little “ friends ” won't be back . I hope your trip home is pleasant . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Sir , did you enjoy your stay here ? __eou__
 Many thanks . __eou__  I hope your stay here was satisfactory , sir . __eou__
 Thank you . I didn't think it would be this simple . __eou__  I can take the $ 10 off your bill , but I need to charge you $ 2 for the service . __eou__
 Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? __eou__  Unfortunately , sir , it's how the computer is programmed . __eou__
 Unfortunately , sir , it's how the computer is programmed . __eou__  This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! __eou__
 I knew you'd see it my way . __eou__  Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill . __eou__
 Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ? __eou__  Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer . __eou__
 This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police ! __eou__  If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way . __eou__
 Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word . __eou__  One slight problem , sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file . __eou__
 You can __eou__  I feel your pain , sir . __eou__
 Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves . __eou__  I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here . __eou__
 I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight . How about another restaurant ? __eou__  The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated . It has great food and live jazz , but it's not cheap . __eou__
 Thank you for taking care of it so quickly . __eou__  Sir , when I deleted the $ 10 , the program automatically added a $ 2 service charge . __eou__
 You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made ! __eou__  Sometimes you can't win for losing , sir . __eou__
 Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is ! __eou__  I don't blame you , sir . Two dollars is a lot of money . __eou__
 Whenever you're ready to check out , I'll be ready , sir . __eou__  Great ! As you know however , the day in New York has hardly begun . __eou__
 Unfortunately , it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice , though . __eou__  Well , then . Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment . __eou__
 I'm ready when you are , sir . __eou__  Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York . __eou__
 We do have a storage space for your bags . There's a small charge , plus a deposit . __eou__  Leave a deposit ? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit ? __eou__
 That won't be a problem , sir . __eou__  That's good to hear . Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me . __eou__
 We have a storage place here , but you have to leave a deposit . __eou__  A deposit , huh ? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit . __eou__
 Thirty minutes or 30 seconds , sir , it doesn't matter , I'm ready for you . __eou__  Great ! As you know , however , the day in New York has hardly begun . __eou__
 No , that won't be necessary . I just need a taxi . __eou__  Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine . That's such a stylish way to travel . __eou__
 No , thanks . A taxi is just fine . __eou__  May I suggest a limo ? It's nice to pamper yourself . __eou__
 I don't want anything except a taxi , thank you . __eou__  I understand . And where will you be going ? __eou__
 A private vehicle , huh ? No , a taxi is okay . __eou__  Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi . __eou__
 No , I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo . __eou__  No upgrade of any kind . And where might you be going ? __eou__
 Thanks , but no thanks . A taxi will do just fine . __eou__  In that case , how about a limo ? Then you can travel in style . __eou__
 No , I hate limousines . They're gas guzzlers . __eou__  Got it , sir . Where would you like the taxi to take you ? __eou__
 A private vehicle ? No , thanks , I won't need one . __eou__  Even better than a private vehicle is a limo . How does that sound ? __eou__
 T A X I , please . __eou__  A taxi it is . Where will you be headed ? __eou__
 No , the taxi will do . __eou__  Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine . __eou__
 No , thank you . Taxis and I get along just fine . __eou__  No private vehicle , no limo . Got it . Where are you going ? __eou__
 Sure . There ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet . __eou__  Thank you . And what ’ s the best way to get downtown ? __eou__
 You ’ Ve been very helpful . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
 Ok ... Here you are . __eou__  Here are your keys . Check out time is noon . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Ok , Mr . Smith . Do you have any bags to check ? __eou__
 It's too bad . They are very delicious . __eou__  I know . One out of every three travelers from Taiwan seems to be carrying them.They are being smuggled in by the thousands . __eou__
 Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! __eou__  Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . __eou__
 Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! __eou__  I understand . Thank you very much ! __eou__
 yes , we can , but it isn ’ t very interesting . __eou__  then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path . __eou__
 Beautiful . __eou__  Do you think I can take a picture through this window ? __eou__
 no . let me take a look ... it ’ s longer than my car . __eou__  I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . __eou__
 I don ’ t really think I ’ m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon . What else do you have ? __eou__  Well , in that case , we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors . It ’ s the closest you can get to flying . __eou__
 What ? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite ? No , thank you ! Next ! __eou__  Mmm . OK . Well , why don ’ t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? We have everything from mountain biking , to rock climbing to street luge . __eou__
 I ’ m thinking something exciting but safer . __eou__  I have the perfect option , this package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there ’ s a dog sledding journey ! __eou__
 I've told you a thousand times . I don't want to go in the Haunted House.It ' s too scary ! __eou__  Well . Maybe I'll go alone then . I really don't want to miss it . __eou__
 Go alone if you want . I will wait at that cafe and have a soda . __eou__  It might take a long time . Because there is a line , you know . __eou__
 No , I don't want to . __eou__  Really . The special effects are fantastic.You shouldn't be scared . You would really enjoy it . __eou__
 Sam , I never like Haunted Houses.When I was a kid , I didn't like them . when I was in high school , I didn't like them.when I was in college , I didn't like them . So why should I like them now ? __eou__  But this is maybe one of the best Haunted Houses in North America ! It's different . __eou__
 Yes . That is something I will enjoy . __eou__  Alright , let's go then . How many tickets do we have left ? __eou__
 I'm sorry . I have nothing here . __eou__  Miss , I know he made this reservation for me . __eou__
 Of course . But today I feel like seeing the White House.We should see it first , because it's the most famous historical building here . __eou__  I don't agree . I think the Capitol building is the most famous.But okay . If you want to see the White House , we'll go see it . I'm just afraid it will be boring . __eou__
 First I want to look in the travel guide.Maybe they don't have tours in the morning . __eou__  That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ? __eou__
 Certainly . __eou__  And do you have any medicine for airsickness ? __eou__
 Well , yes . I'll give him the medicine , too . __eou__  I appreciate your help . __eou__
 OK.Here you are . __eou__  Do you have anything to declare ? __eou__
 Oh , yes , ma'am . We'll come right away then.Your room number and your name , please . __eou__  Our room number is eleven-seven and my name is Terry Chen . __eou__
 I'm afraid we have no reservation by this name . __eou__  No reservation ? Well , then , do you have any rooms available ? __eou__
 I'm afraid all the rooms are fully booked . __eou__  You mean we can't stay in this hotel tonight ? __eou__
 You're right.We have no more rooms available for tonight . __eou__  Then , would you recommend any other nearby hotel ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.Mr.Jones needs a telephone call from you . __eou__
 I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment . __eou__  Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately . __eou__
 We're sorry , but single rooms have been occupied . __eou__  What's the room rate ? It's little expensive for me.Do you have any other room ? __eou__

 I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep . __eou__  When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub . __eou__

 Yes , please . __eou__  I'm sorry to say that this room service charge is yours . __eou__
 we ’ ll try to arrange it , but I can ’ t guarantee sir . __eou__  That ’ s fine . __eou__
 We keep it and return it later . __eou__  Oh , I see.Then can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? __eou__
 I'm afraid you can't . __eou__  I talked with the manager over the phone and he told me I can have it reissued because I have a copy of my lost ticket . __eou__
 That ’ s alright . __eou__  Please put your luggage outside your room by eight . The bail-boy will pick them up . __eou__

 Yup . __eou__  Is this camera a gift for someone ? __eou__
 No , please don't . It's is for my personal use . __eou__  You have a lot of gifts , so you have to pay for the camera . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  This is my luggage , but it's too heavy . I can't move it . Could you help me get it out of the conveyer belt ? __eou__
 Certainly , it's a pleasure . __eou__  Where shall we go next ? __eou__
 No , I don't . __eou__  Would you like to open the suitcase , please ? __eou__

 Yes , It ’ s essential . __eou__  What about our luggage ? __eou__
 Yes . There will be one at the end of this month . For many people , a Hawaiian vacation promises languid days filled with sunbathing and poolside cocktails . For others , it ’ s all about non-stop action in one of the world's most extreme natural playgrounds .

 Yes , please . __eou__  I'm sorry to say this room charge is yours . __eou__
 we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience . __eou__  What's the matter ? __eou__
 Is it really going to take that long , will you rush the order ? __eou__  I'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  I am sorry to have kept you waiting . Mr . Johns needs a telephone call from you . __eou__
 I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment . __eou__  Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately . __eou__
 I did it . __eou__  Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door . __eou__
 Ok , I will . __eou__  I will have our housekeeper come right away . __eou__
 I am sorry , I was too tired to fall asleep . __eou__  When you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ? __eou__
 Oh , certainly . __eou__  And also tell me how to use other switches . __eou__
 We are sorry , but single rooms have been occupied . __eou__  What's the room rate ? It is a little expensive for me , do you have any other rooms ? __eou__
 I'm afraid not . I'm sick . I have a fever but I'm cold , and I threw up earlier . __eou__  Oh , man . I hope you get to feeling better . __eou__
 I would feel better if you came over and took care of me . __eou__  OK , then . I'll be there in a minute . __eou__
 Enough . I don't want to hear any more about your bathroom time . __eou__  Why not ? Oh well , I'm ready to eat . No need call the doctor . If we run to the restaurant , I can make it to the restroom and you can order . __eou__
 I've tried before . Everything I've tried doesn't work . __eou__  Maybe with the choice of life or death before you , you will find it easier . __eou__
 No problem . We'll give you both calls . __eou__  Do you know what , let's change the second call to 7 thirty . __eou__
 No problem . Anything else , sir ? __eou__  Not at the moment , thank you . __eou__
 We can certainly do that . Expect a call from us at 7 o'colock and then again at 7 fifteen . __eou__  Actually , can I change the latter wake-up call to 7 thirty . am ? __eou__
 I can certainly do that . Is there anything else ? __eou__  I can't think of anything . If I do think of something , I'll be sure to call again . __eou__
 I ’ ll bring the card . Thank you very much . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 But I can't just slow down . __eou__  You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size . __eou__
 No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed . __eou__  Thanks . Do you sell aspirin here ? __eou__
 Here's a twenty . __eou__  Here's your change . Thank you . __eou__
 Oh , I see . I will tell my wife . Thank you for telling me so much . __eou__  It's nothing . Did your doctor explain to you about what operation you are going to have ? __eou__
 All right . __eou__  Good.Now the other eye . __eou__
 Well , this one is worse . __eou__  Never mind , just read as far as you can . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ? __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ? __eou__
 No , I'll e paying for myself , but I have private medical insurance . __eou__  In that case , I'll give you a certificate , so you can get it reimbursed . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork . __eou__
 Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . __eou__  I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . __eou__
 I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . __eou__  But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . __eou__
 Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . __eou__  But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . __eou__
 A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . __eou__  Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . __eou__
 Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . __eou__  This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__
 It's gone completely . __eou__  Show me your tongue , please . All right , stay in bed and keep yourself warm . I'll prescribe some pills for you to take . __eou__
 But I can't just slow down . __eou__  You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size . __eou__
 Yes , that's for sure . But it is not that bad . It's gonna be all right . __eou__  Oh , doctor , please ... __eou__
 Be brave , young man . Only girls cry when given an injection . __eou__  You are right . I won't cry anymore . __eou__
 Thank you , doctor . Goodbye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
 Okay , this is the third time . __eou__  What ? How come ? The third time ? __eou__
 How beautiful they are ! Thank you so much . __eou__  I've also brought some magazines for you . I hope they'll keep you from getting bored while you're in the hospital . __eou__
 You're so thoughtful ! __eou__  It's time for me to leave . I hope you will recover soon.See you later . __eou__
 That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow . __eou__  Do you think I can get back to work very soon ? __eou__
 It's very kind of you . __eou__  You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery.Goodbye . __eou__
 Of course not . You need a good rest . __eou__  OK , I'll listen to you . __eou__
 That sounds very interesting ! __eou__  Please don't eat turnip and garlic when taking this medicine . __eou__
 Yeah , I guess I can survive until tomorrow . __eou__  Would you prefer to come in in the morning or the afternoon ? __eou__
 The doctor has an opening at 10:30 tomorrow . I'll put you down for then . __eou__  That would be fine . __eou__
 Okay . __eou__  Goodbye , Randy . Take care . __eou__
 Sure , John Sandals . __eou__  Hi , Mr . Sandals . I'm Michelle , at your service . When do you need the room ? __eou__

 Of course ! It's area code 626-555-1739 . __eou__  Thank you so much , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you ! __eou__
 Of course . I'm John Sandals . __eou__  Hi , sir . My name is Michelle . Could you tell me when you need the room ? __eou__
 That sounds fine to me . __eou__  Fantastic ! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ? __eou__
 That'll be no problem . __eou__  I'm happy to hear that , sir . Your reservation is all set except for your phone number . __eou__
 Sure ! My number is 626-555-1739 . __eou__  626-555-1739 . Thank you for doing business with us , Mr . Sandals . __eou__
 Yes , that'll be just fine . __eou__  One more second , sir . Your reservation is now verified , so all I need is your phone number . __eou__
 $ 308 a night ? That's a fair price . __eou__  Now , as for the room , sir , do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ? __eou__
 I have absolutely no problem with that . __eou__  Queen , nonsmoking . Okay , sir , your room is reserved . Now if you'll just give me your phone number . __eou__
 That's a reasonable price . __eou__  Good ! Now , sir , do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking ? __eou__
 A queen sounds great . __eou__  Okay , sir , let me reserve those dates , there . Now , if you'll just tell me your phone number . __eou__
 OK . Thanks a lot . __eou__  That's nothing . __eou__
 No , thanks . I am very grateful that you can come to the hospital to visit me . __eou__  You are my best friend . That's what I should do . Please don ’ t be a stranger . __eou__
 Yes , you are right . __eou__  And you'd take some exercise every day . __eou__
 Of course I know . __eou__  Now you can go to the in-patient department to go through the admission procedures . __eou__
 Yeah , I guess I can survive until tomorrow . __eou__  Would you prefer to come in in the morning or the afternoon ? __eou__
 That would be fine . __eou__  Okay , Mr . Horn , see you tomorrow at 10:30 . __eou__
 Here's a twenty . __eou__  Here's your change . Thank you . __eou__
 Okay . __eou__  Goodbye , Randy . Take care . __eou__
 Oh , fine . Let's take a look . __eou__  ( She probed my teeth and checked my gums . ) Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the crown needs to be refitted . Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them . __eou__
 All right , thanks . __eou__  The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection . __eou__
 But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! __eou__  Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . __eou__
 I see . I'll follow your instructions . __eou__  And take a good rest for a few days . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Drink a lot of water and have a good rest . You'll be well soon . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 I ’ m afraid not . He will be not free until 11:30 . __eou__  How about 1:30 ? __eou__
 That ’ s fine . Thanks . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ? __eou__
 Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but she won't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there's a cancellation . __eou__  Would 1 : OO p . m . be convenient ? __eou__
 Nothing works with my toothache now . __eou__  You should go to the dentist . __eou__
 I hate dentists . __eou__  Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . __eou__
 It always hurts . I hate going . __eou__  Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . __eou__
 OK , OK , I ’ ll go . __eou__  Good . You will feel better after you do . __eou__
 I'm afraid there's nothing available before noon . __eou__  How about 12:45 ? __eou__
 I have said that we will try our best . You can trust us . But you know her situation . __eou__  How long do you expect her to live ? __eou__
 Yes . Here you are . __eou__  Please register your information here and pay for it . And I ’ ll make a medical record for you . __eou__
 Here is my money . __eou__  This is your registration card . Please don ’ t lose it and bring it whenever you come . __eou__
 Ah . __eou__  Your throat is inflamed . And your tongue is heavily coated . You have all the symptoms of influenza . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  It's my pleasure . __eou__
 Thank you very much , doctor . __eou__  Not at all . You'll be OK soon . __eou__
 I hate dentists . __eou__  Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . __eou__
 It always hurts . I hate going . __eou__  Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . __eou__
 O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go . __eou__  Good . You'll feel better after you do . __eou__
 O . K . __eou__  Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit . __eou__  Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave . __eou__
 Well , thanks very much . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Well , thanks very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Thank you ! __eou__  You are welcome ! __eou__
 Well , I see . Thanks . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 That is no problem at all , of course . You'll get a call at 7 o'colock and another at 7 fifteen . __eou__  Then again , I think 7 fifteen is too early . Change 7 fifteen to 7 thirty , please . __eou__
 Not a problem . We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7 , and again at 7 fifteen . __eou__  On second thought , you'd better make that second call at 7 thirty instead of 7 fifteen . __eou__
 It'll be our pleasure . We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen . __eou__  Oops , cancel that . Change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ? __eou__
 No , that's about it for now . Thanks . __eou__  Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening . __eou__
 Your wish is our command . Expect a call at 7 , and another one at 7 fifteen . __eou__  Wait a minute ! I don't like 7 fifteen , now that I think about it . Change it to 7 thirty . __eou__
 How dare you question my statement ! __eou__  Forgive me . You're 100 percent correct . Allow me to transfer you to my supervisor . __eou__
 There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief ! __eou__  I apologize . One moment , please , while I transfer you to my supervisor . __eou__
 The next cockroach I see will be number ten . __eou__  Mr . Sandals , I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach . __eou__
 I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you ! __eou__  You're right , sir . Please let me transfer you to my supervisor __eou__
 Forgive me , sir , I haven't been told what the problem is . __eou__  I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches ! __eou__
 Thank you . I didn't want to have to take this to court . __eou__  Sir , we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy . __eou__
 Certainly . Here it is . __eou__  Thank you . Do you have a credit card , Mr . Sandals ? __eou__
 Sorry , sir , just VISA or MasterCard . __eou__  Okay . Here's my VISA card . __eou__
 Yes , it sounds like everything I expected . __eou__  Here's your key , sir . If you need anything , just dial 0 on your room phone . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir . Only VISA or MasterCard . __eou__  In that case , here's my VISA . __eou__
 Yes , I'm easy to please . __eou__  Very good . Here is your room key , sir . If you need anything at all , please dial 0 . __eou__
 I'm sorry , Mr . Sandals , but we accept only MasterCard or VISA . __eou__  That's okay , I've got plenty of cards . Here's my VISA . __eou__
 Yes , that's just what I wanted . __eou__  Here's your key , sir . If you need anything , just dial 0 on your room phone . __eou__
 Unfortunately , at the present time we take only MasterCard or VISA . __eou__  No American Express ? Okay , here's my VISA . __eou__
 Yeah , that'll be fine . __eou__  That's great . This is your key , sir . If you need anything at all , anytime , just dial zero . __eou__
 Regrettably , Mr . Sandals , we accept only MasterCard or VISA . __eou__  I thought American Express was accepted everywhere . Never mind . Here's my VISA . __eou__
 Yes , that's just fine . __eou__  I'm happy to hear that . Here is your key . Just dial 0 if you need anything . __eou__
 I'm very sorry , sir . We accept only VISA or MasterCard . __eou__  No problem . Here's my VISA . __eou__
 Yes , that sounds like what I want . __eou__  That's wonderful , sir . Now , here's your key . Should you need anything , just dial 0 . __eou__
 Well , I don't have an Ethernet port . My computer runs entirely on wireless service . __eou__  That's too bad . But there are several alternatives , if you want to hear them . __eou__
 Yes , please ! Tell me about the alternatives . __eou__  We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor . __eou__
 I knew there would be a few choices , but this selection is huge ! __eou__  You're looking for a multi though , right ? __eou__
 Oh ! You took the guesswork right out of that one . __eou__  That's my job ! Is there anything else I can assist you with ? __eou__
 That price is perfectly acceptable . __eou__  Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ? __eou__
 That sounds fine . __eou__  Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number . __eou__
 I'm afraid not . __eou__  Really , because spicy food is my favorite . __eou__
 Thank you very much . This has been a most unsettling experience . __eou__  Sir , our guests are our reason for being . __eou__
 Ok , go ahead . __eou__  Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week . __eou__
 Thank you . I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars . __eou__  Sir , without happy guests , we are nothing . __eou__
 Thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence . __eou__  Sir , only your mother wants to please you more than we do . __eou__
 Ahhhhhhhh __eou__  Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ? __eou__
 Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care . __eou__  Thanks doc , bye ! __eou__
 Yes , I know . It ’ s not the first time I ’ m taking this ! Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t overdose ! __eou__  Okay , anything else I can get you ? __eou__
 Sure . Darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system . __eou__  Oh , well that ’ s okay , I ’ ll get some later , thanks ... Really it ’ s no problem . __eou__
 Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . __eou__  I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . __eou__
 I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . __eou__  But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . __eou__
 Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . __eou__  But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . __eou__
 A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . __eou__  Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . __eou__
 Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . __eou__  This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__
 Much better . I will definitely go to the airport to meet you . __eou__  Thank you very much . Goodbye . __eou__
 This could become a very expensive trip to the beauty parlor ! __eou__  I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? __eou__
 Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . __eou__  Maybe we should try a thai massage too . __eou__
 Sorry , I'm supposed to be with my son . __eou__  Okay , I'll ask Bob to cover it . __eou__
 It makes no sense to tell him about that . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 Oh , hi , Leo . Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__  Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office . __eou__
 But I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work . __eou__  That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out . __eou__
 No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you . __eou__  How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? __eou__
 Oh , that would be too small . __eou__  With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . __eou__
 I realize that now . I will do that after a while . __eou__  Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ? __eou__
 Of course , let me help you . __eou__  The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great ! __eou__
 Good idea . We can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning . __eou__  Sure thing . Do you want me to give you a ride home ? __eou__
 That ’ s great . Thanks for the ride . I really appreciate 1 it . You know my car is still in the shop . __eou__  Don't mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . __eou__
 Thank you . You ’ Ve been so nice to me . __eou__  Is there anything else I can do for you before your leave ? __eou__
 No , thanks . You ’ Ve done a lot for me already . Thank you for everything . __eou__  Don ’ t mention it . I ’ Ve really enjoyed your company . __eou__
 Of course , such as Alabama , which is a famous website . __eou__  Thank you . Maybe I will do business through internet in the future . __eou__
 We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate . __eou__  That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase . __eou__
 I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__  But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ? __eou__
 I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up . __eou__  To be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That will tie up my money and add to my cost . __eou__
 Yes , you can have it delivered or filled at any location in our HMO . __eou__  When should I take this medication ? __eou__
 Yes , and you can renew this prescription by phone . __eou__  Are there any special instructions about this medication ? __eou__
 OK . I can afford to take a fell days off work . __eou__  have you been working hard recently ? __eou__
 But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football ! __eou__  You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ? __eou__
 No . __eou__  Would you like the shapes square or round ? __eou__
 that ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand . __eou__  yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon . __eou__
 I don't think that was suit me very well , blond is kind of erratic . __eou__  What do you think about pink ? __eou__
 Certainly , doctor . Come upstairs . __eou__  You look very well , Jimmy . You are better now , but you mustn't get up yet.You must stay in bed for another two days.The boy mustn't go to school yet , Mrs Williams . And he mustn't eat rich food . __eou__
 I must see the dentist now , nurse . __eou__  The dentist is very busy at the moment . Can you come at 2 PM ? __eou__
 That's very late . Can the dentist see me now ? __eou__  I'm afraid that he can't , Mr Croft . Can't you wait till this afternoon ? __eou__
 Ok , go ahead . __eou__  Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week . __eou__
Sorry sir . But you can ’ t go into the OR . __eou__  All right , but tell me what ’ s happening . Give it to me straight please . __eou__
 Thanks for helping her , doctor . __eou__  All right . Just relax , OK ? Go and got a cup of coffee . __eou__
 Ok . __eou__  Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? __eou__
 I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit . __eou__  Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Don't worry about your flu . You will be OK soon . __eou__
 No , Mom . I'm really sick . __eou__  Oh , that's a nasty cough . Let me feel your head . You're on fire ! __eou__
 Why not ! Before you know it , I'll be heading off to the mountains to stand on my head ! __eou__  You don't have to go to the mountains ! I stand on my head during my yoga routine every morning ! __eou__
 Mmm ... __eou__  Oh , you've got a fever . One-oh-one ... time to break out the children's Tylenol . __eou__
 sounds reasonable . __eou__  we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . __eou__
 Ya . And now I can break this to you . Fanny is moving . __eou__  Oh , right . What a load off my mind . I really don ’ t like her . __eou__
 wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it . __eou__  OK , I'll take it . __eou__
 Here . __eou__  What kind of pain ? Sharp pain , dull pain or severe pain ? __eou__
 All right . __eou__  Does it hurt when I push here ? __eou__
 Yes , doctor . ( The doctor examines the patient ) __eou__  Well , there's nothing very much wrong with you , I'm glad to say.You ' re working too hard and worrying too much.Do you take much exercise ? __eou__
 But I may lose my job , doctor ! It's hard to get a job like mine . __eou__  Then get an easier one , even if you earn less money . Which would you rather have , health or wealth ? __eou__
 You're right , doctor . It's more important to be healthy than wealthy . I'll change my job . I'm grateful for your advice . __eou__  Come and see me again in a month's time . I think you'll be a different man ! __eou__
 I can do a chest X-ray to check for congestion . __eou__  That would be great . What is the blood test for ? __eou__
 No , I think that I should just go home because I have some medicine there . __eou__  Do you need a ride home ? __eou__
 I already have some medicine at home if I could just get there . __eou__  Do you need someone to drive you home ? __eou__
 Thank you , but the bus stops right at my house . __eou__  Well , go home and rest up . Make sure you check the website for your assignments . __eou__
 I don ’ t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question . __eou__  I want to see you right away . __eou__
 If there is any question about test results , we always do a recheck . __eou__  I need to come in right away . __eou__
 Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . __eou__  I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . __eou__
 I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . __eou__  But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . __eou__

I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . __eou__  This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__
 Yes , I will check you for asthma , and maybe we can check you for allergies later . __eou__  Thank you . What will the blood test tell you ? __eou__
 I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room . __eou__  Let me see a doctor . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 . __eou__  I thought this was the emergency room . __eou__
 O . K . __eou__  Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit . __eou__  Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave . __eou__
 C'mon . Just don't move . __eou__  I'm bleeding too much . __eou__
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . __eou__  No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . __eou__
 I hate dentists . __eou__  Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . __eou__
 It always hurts . I hate going . __eou__  Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . __eou__
 O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go . __eou__  Good . You feel better after you do . __eou__
 I have some medicine at home that I could take . __eou__  Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ? __eou__
 Ahhhhhhhh __eou__  Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ? __eou__
 Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care . __eou__  Thanks doc , bye ! __eou__
 I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room . __eou__  Let me see a doctor . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 . __eou__  I thought this was the emergency room . __eou__
 No , I can't . I'm left-handed . __eou__  That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . __eou__
 Thanks doc ! __eou__  Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom . __eou__
 Yes , here you are . __eou__  Please fill in this admission card . Well , how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ? __eou__
 Yes , I know . It ’ s not the first time I ’ m taking this ! Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t overdose ! __eou__  Okay , anything else I can get you ? __eou__
 Sure . Darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system . __eou__  Oh , well that ’ s okay , I ’ ll get some later , thanks ... Really it ’ s no problem . __eou__
 Thanks doc ! __eou__  Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom . __eou__
 It's very kind of you . __eou__  You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye . __eou__
 All right . __eou__  Good . Now the other eye . __eou__
 Well , this one is worse . __eou__  Never mind , just read as far as you can . __eou__
 Ah ... __eou__  And show me your tongue ... Thank you . That'll do . You have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . How is your appetite ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 I'm sorry . All the appointments are filled . __eou__  Oh , what a pity . I'd like to see the doctor as soon as possible . I have a sharp pain in my chest . __eou__
 Five thirty ? I have a dinner appointment at six . __eou__  What about tomorrow morning , then ? __eou__
 No . I can't wait . I feel awful . The dinner appointment has to be canceled . __eou__  I guess it can't be helped . __eou__
 All right , then . See you this afternoon . __eou__  How kind of you ! Good-bye . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ? __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ? __eou__
 Then I might as well have it done now . __eou__  you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . __eou__
 OK . I can afford to take a few days off work . __eou__  Have you been working hard recently ? __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions . __eou__
 ah . __eou__  Yes , It does look a bit sore.Let ’ s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests . __eou__
 All right , thanks . __eou__  The tests showed nothing wrong . a slight by infection . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions . __eou__
 All right . __eou__  Name , age and date of birth , please ? __eou__
 Well , doctor ? __eou__  You'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure . __eou__
 I don't have time to talk to her now . __eou__  OK , I'll take a message . __eou__
 We have no choice but to hold you responsible for the loss we sustained . __eou__  The first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation . About the second problem , I admit it's our fault , so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample . __eou__
 Well . I hope there won't be such things . __eou__  I can assure you that such a thing today will never happen again in future delivery . We have made the plan to improve the package of our exported goods . __eou__
 That ’ s all right . We will pay you 4 , 000 yuan a month for supporting your family . Would you like to start on next Monday ? __eou__  No problem . Thank you for hiring me , I am very proud to be employed by your company and I will come in at eight o ’ clock sharp Monday . __eou__
 Thank you . Miss Kelly . __eou__  What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ? __eou__
 Yes , I would . ( After testing ) __eou__  Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? __eou__
 Yes , I'd like to give it a try . __eou__  All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let ’ s go to his office . __eou__
 I am used to editing with Word 2003 , and there are many pictures in the book . __eou__  It's beyond question . You can save it the same as a document . __eou__
 Wonderful . Thank you very much . I have been dreaming to work with your company and I am finally granted the great opportunity . I won ’ t let you down and I hope you will contact me when you have any questions . __eou__  I will , thank you for calling . __eou__
 I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension number . __eou__  Oh . Then I don't know what his number is . Can you check it for me ? __eou__
 OK . Hold on , please . __eou__  OK . Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . You helped me a lot . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 Yes . Thank you very much . I am looking forward to hearing from you . __eou__  Good luck to you , good-bye . __eou__
 Yes , of course . What is it ? __eou__  I've decided to leave . __eou__
 I'm really sorry . But I understand . __eou__  Thank you , manager . __eou__
 Oh , OK , I said ( XXXXXXXXXX ) on time . __eou__  Sorry Tom , We're having problems hearing you here . It ’ s a bit hissy . Can you hear us ? __eou__
 That's all right . What can I do ? __eou__  Firstly , you should go to the supermarket , which is nearest to our company , to buy some fruit , drinks , desserts and cakes . Here is the list of things you need to buy . __eou__
 Well . I can do it . And then ? __eou__  The meeting room on the Fourth Floor needs to be swept . Jerry and Tom will help you at that time . Any questions ? __eou__
 Don't worry about that . I have already calculated the money about things you will buy . Remember to give me the receipt when you come back . __eou__  OK . I will go in no time . __eou__
 I see . Thank you . Sir , what kind of duties will I do ? __eou__  B , your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them . Is that difficult ? __eou__
 It's easy . Is there anything I can do for you , sir ? __eou__  Well . I have nearly forgotten . Mr Green from ABC Company had an appointment with me , but I will be very busy at that time . If he calls , you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week . __eou__
 Eight weeks ? We can wait that long . __eou__  That's the best we can do just now , I'm afraid . __eou__
 That's right . __eou__  When can we expect your confirmation of the order ? __eou__
 That will be no problem . We never use any kind of inferior packaging . Your goods will be safe . __eou__  Good . Can we ask you to put a country of origin mark on each container ? __eou__
 We always do that , but I will make a point to check it for you since it is so important . __eou__  Do you always put a quality mark on each container ? For this shipment it is crucial to us that you do . __eou__
 We don't usually do that unless we are asked to . I'lI tell my staff to take care of this for you . __eou__  Thanks . This shipment is so important to us there cannot be any foul-ups . __eou__
 In that case , I guess I can rest assured . __eou__  Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too . __eou__
 Yes , I did this in the morning . And my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days . __eou__  That's good . Do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow ? __eou__
 I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C . __eou__  But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem . __eou__
 I don't think we can make it . __eou__  Then when at the earliest can we expect the shipment ? __eou__
 Payment by sight L / C is quite usual in international trade , and as a rule , we only accept payment by sight L / C . __eou__  But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it . __eou__
 I also realized this issue . And office automation is essential . __eou__  Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age . __eou__
 Good idea . A network of work stations is helpful for our management . __eou__  And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function . __eou__
 That's right . __eou__  After overcoming these buttons , you should check whether there is any paper in the machine , you must make sure this . __eou__
 I couldn't agree more . __eou__  And then prepare what you want to receive . If you want to send a photograph , you must copy one . __eou__
 I can agree to that . __eou__  Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 . Right ? __eou__
 Well , I trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms . __eou__  I would like to explain to you our financial position . The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . __eou__
 A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . __eou__  Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . __eou__
 I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . __eou__  So do I . __eou__
 Yes , of course . We have enough productivity . You can rest assured . __eou__  And for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount . __eou__
 Sure , we can reduce our price by ten percent . __eou__  That's great . __eou__
 No problem . Once we get your purchase order , we will begin the execution of the order right away . __eou__  Thanks . We need the products in less than one month , because we have a big deal with another company . By the way , will payment against delivery be OK ? __eou__
 Well , actually in most cases we don't talk about special deals , but since this one is so new I will listen to what you have to say . __eou__  We want to make this a trial order . If we can sell all the products in two months , we will pay for them ; if not , we will send them back to you . __eou__
 I can't agree to that . My company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back . __eou__  We promise that if the products are sold out in two months , we will place a repeat order right away , at the same quality . __eou__
 Great idea . __eou__  Well , I am worried to death right now ! There is still no news from the company for me . __eou__
 Of course . A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ? __eou__  Yes , I have read . In the contract , I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . Is that right ? __eou__
 Well , sir , I am busy in market development . So I am worried whether I can do this . __eou__  I am aware you have been working so hard . Before hiring more employees , you are still needed to do this . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  Here is your working place . Nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones . I'm going to call her now so that you can get started . Is that OK ? __eou__
 Yes , that's OK . I'm glad to get started . __eou__  If you have any further questions , just ask me . __eou__
 OK . Thank you very much . __eou__  You are welcome . Have a nice day . __eou__
 OK . I know . But Bob wanted to change shifts with me tonight . __eou__  Did he say why ? __eou__
 It is convenient for me to work overtime tonight . __eou__  Thank you for that . And I will double your pay . __eou__
 Go ahead . __eou__  How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? __eou__
 I feel so sorry that Nova has gone on her business trip . __eou__  Really ? When will she come back ? __eou__
 Good idea ! The pictures will illustrate the performance of our products vividly . __eou__  OK , I will prepare it right now . __eou__
 OK , I will prepare it right now . __eou__  A , do your best , it's very important . __eou__
 Thank you . I hope to hear from you as soon as possible . __eou__  Please send the next candidate in on your way out . __eou__
 Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files . __eou__  Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' . __eou__
 I am afraid we are sticking to our choice . __eou__  Possibly you are now . But in case you will change your mind , please let me know . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  How would you seat them ? __eou__
 Hold on please . __eou__  Hello , I'm afraid Mike's unavailable right now . He's in a meeting . Can I take a message ? __eou__
 Great . Thanks . __eou__  Anything else ? __eou__
 Bingo ! I never thought about that before . I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know . __eou__  So you suppose you deserve a salary raise . __eou__
 That sounds reasonable . __eou__  Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency . __eou__
 That's a point . It seems a little complicated . I will think about this for a while . I owe you one . After all , you give me an inspiration . __eou__  Forget it . Good luck . I hope you can make it . __eou__
 Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Thank you very much . __eou__  I ’ Ve read your application materials with interest . Now I want to ask you a few questions , if you don ’ t mind . __eou__
 As you please . I ’ m ready . __eou__  The first is why you choose our company ? __eou__
 Well , I really appreciate your coming today . __eou__  The pleasure is mine . It ’ s nice talking with you . Good-bye , Mr . Owens . __eou__
 Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided . __eou__  Sounds like we have the same idea . __eou__
 That is one of reasons why I am here now . I am really willing to have some cooperation with your company . __eou__  We intend to establish business relationship with your company on the basis of equality and mutual benefit . __eou__
 Thank you very much for offering me this opportunity . __eou__  It has been pleasant talking with you . __eou__
 We'll get in touch with you by next Wednesday . Thank you for your interest in this job . __eou__  Thank you for your interview . __eou__
 Well , I understand . __eou__  Please make a detailed schedule on the visit this afternoon . __eou__
 Wait for a moment , please . Let me check whether the private room is available or not . No problem . __eou__  It will be for business dinner . Reserve it under the name of Nova , the manager of Fashion Clothes Company . __eou__
 Of course , here you are . And you can ask me any question . __eou__  Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__
 Of course . If you have any questions , just bring them out . __eou__  OK , thank you . Well , I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview . Can you give me some explanations ? __eou__
 Yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement . Do you have any other questions ? __eou__  No , thank you . Shall we sign the agreement now ? __eou__
 Yes , welcome to our company . I hope we can cooperate happily . __eou__  Thank you . I'll work hard . __eou__
 You go ! __eou__  According to your schedule , you will visit the Times Company , including its office building , workshops and stores , in the morning from 8: 30 to 11 __eou__
 Yes , it is quite satisfactory . I accept it . __eou__  Any question about the work ? __eou__
 I will set it up . __eou__  They will stay for two days . Try to work out an efficient schedule . __eou__
 Good . I will add this to the contract . __eou__  The second thing I would like to point out , that is packaging . It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . But I think the wooden cases are much safer . __eou__
 Well , you are right . Is there anything else ? __eou__  As far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . Thank you very much . __eou__
 If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . __eou__  Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ? __eou__
 That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . __eou__  Sounds good . __eou__
 Yes . The price differs depending on how many you want . __eou__  Is the price negotiable ? __eou__
 It ’ s quite convenient . __eou__  Thank you for your interest in our company . __eou__
 We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . __eou__  If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ? __eou__
 I am sorry to say that it's a little higher . Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission . __eou__  You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__
 Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . __eou__  Oh , that's pitiful . __eou__
 What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now . __eou__  But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ? __eou__
 It seems that I have nothing to do , except this . __eou__  Face the reality . Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss . __eou__
 If you order a large amount , we can give you a discount . __eou__  Well , can you explain it to me ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price . __eou__  In that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . Please reconsider . __eou__
 It is so hard to deal with . __eou__  If you can give us a more reduction , We'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__
 You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . __eou__  I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies . __eou__
 But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . __eou__  I agree that yours are of the top . __eou__
 In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price . __eou__  I can't agree with you . We have quotation from other sources too . Their prices are lower than yours . __eou__
 But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . In fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year . __eou__  It doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price . __eou__
 I'm afraid not . That is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way . __eou__  What about the cost of delivery ? __eou__
 Yes , I'll talk to her . __eou__  All right . __eou__
 Of course , here you are . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 No , tell him I'm tied up . __eou__  When should I tell him to call back ? __eou__
 All right . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Certainly , hold on . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Certainly ! __eou__  Please ask her to call John . __eou__
 Oh . I'm sorry but I just accepted another offer which I feel is better suited to my needs . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 I really appreciate the offer , but I must decline it . __eou__  Please call us if you change your mind . __eou__
 Say it . __eou__  As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series . __eou__
 That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task . __eou__  I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign . __eou__
 That's a bit more than I was prepared to pay . __eou__  How about 130 yuan ? __eou__
 If you order more than 10,000 pieces , we can accept 115 yuan for each one . __eou__  Well , I'll accept the price and place an order for 10,000 pieces . __eou__
 Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . __eou__  Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . __eou__
 I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . __eou__  Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract . __eou__
 Oh , yes . That's fine with me . Maybe we can have lunch together . __eou__  Great . I'll see you on the 7th . __eou__
 I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00 __eou__  That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? __eou__
 I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem . In fact , he's booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon . __eou__  Tomorrow afternoon , Um ... you see , I've made an appointment with Mr . Comet for tomorrow afternoon . In order to meet Mr . Zhang , I have to cancel the appointment with Mr . Comet , I'm afraid . __eou__
 Well , I don't like it , but I guess I don't have any choice . __eou__  How about Monday morning at 9 a . m . ? __eou__
 The cement arrived late but don't worry , I'm confident we can still meet the deadline . The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again . __eou__  OK . Keep me informed . Jt must be ready on time . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  You can get your supplies upstairs from Mrs . Horn . __eou__
 Yes . I have to stay in bed today , but I'll be able to come tomorrow . __eou__  That's all right . Have a good rest until you feel well enough . __eou__
 I don ’ t think we can give you that much as the starting salary . __eou__  You know , Mr . Allen , Nowadays this starting salary is not high based on my skills and experience . __eou__
 OK , 4000 yuan a month . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Good . Please come in on Monday . Working hours are from eight to four-thirty . Lunch is fifty-five minutes . __eou__  Yes , sir . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  According to your performance , I decided to give you a salary increase . From next month , there will be a 2,000 yuan raise to your salary . Although your first raise might not sound considerable , the company believes that with your ability , sooner or later you'll get a better raise . __eou__
 Thank you , sir . __eou__  We've looked over your letter and resume and I'm very satisfied with them . Today I want to invite you talk about insurance you're interested in . __eou__
 Of course . A two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek . __eou__  Good . Anything else ? __eou__
 No problem . We can offer you a flat with two bedrooms and a living room . __eou__  That ’ s great . If you don ’ t mind my asking , does your company give bonuses ? __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  If you are satisfied with the conditions here , please sign this contract and give it to me . __eou__
 All right , Alice . But this is the last time . I also have a lot of work to do . __eou__  Thank you , Kenvir . You're so kind . __eou__
 All right . What's the problem ? __eou__  I really can't work overtime . Because my husband has been ill recently , I must take care of him . __eou__
 Of course not . __eou__  OK . Does your present employer know that you are going to leave ? __eou__
 I know , and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance . It's safer that way . __eou__  Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat . __eou__
 Well , I ’ ll wait . __eou__  Would you like something to drink , sir ? Do you prefer coffee or tea ? __eou__
 Yes , I suppose we must . I have enjoyed all these days that you have spent with me , and I'll always remember them . I've learned a lot from you . Thank you for all your kindness . __eou__  I'm glad you could come to see us off . I have enjoyed your interpreting . You have done a wonderful job . I hope you be my interpreter again next time I'm here . __eou__
 I hope so , too . __eou__  It's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country , but nothing lasts for ever . I have to go back home this time , but I'm sure I'll return very soon . __eou__
 I'm really glad to hear that __eou__  Good-bye . Miss Li , say hello to your husband and your son for me . See you soon . __eou__
 Hey , that's not fair . I did as much work as you . __eou__  Okay , okay , we'll split it 50/50 . __eou__
 Sorry , I'm busy . Why don't you ask Alice ? __eou__  Okay . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  You are scheduled to meet Mr . Thompson of ABC Company at eleven this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Li . And this afternoon at four you will attend a press conference . __eou__
 Yes , thank you very much . In addition , do you have the marketing proposal ready ? __eou__  The proposal is being repaired right now and I think it will be ready by tomorrow morning . __eou__
 No , often my boss requires overtime work . __eou__  How much money are you making a month ? __eou__
 No , I think I didn't like your method . __eou__  Well , have it your way . __eou__
 Thanks for your help . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 Sure , but I have to finish this report first . __eou__  Never mind . I'll do it . __eou__
 I am sorry . He's out in a meeting now . Could I ask who is calling ? __eou__  This is Mr . Smith of XYZ Company . When will he be back ? __eou__
 He's not in , I'm afraid . __eou__  But Could you tell me when he will be back ? __eou__
 I am sorry , I don't know . __eou__  well , do you think I could leave a message for him ? __eou__
 You're on . __eou__  When do you leave ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  We hope your stay here a pleasant one ! __eou__
 Let me check my diary . Er . I'm afraid I can't make Tuesday . I've got to go to Beijing for a conference . I'll come back on Thursday . __eou__  That's a pity . Does Friday suit you ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Did you have a good trip ? __eou__
 I'd like to . Let's go . __eou__  This way , please . Our car is waiting over there . __eou__
 Of course , sir ... Here's the minutes of the meeting . __eou__  How long did the meeting last ? __eou__
 Certainly , Mr . Baker . __eou__  Could you please double space it so I can make corrections ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws , bolts , nuts , pins , studs , and that kind of things . __eou__
 OK , I'll do it right now . __eou__  By the way , to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip . __eou__
 Yes , I get it . __eou__  OK , it's no anything . Do what you should do . __eou__
 Of course , Mr . Green . __eou__  Can you print it out before 12 o'clock ? I need it this afternoon . __eou__
 No problem . I will do it immediately . __eou__  Please double space it and print it out on the laser printer so I can read it easily . __eou__
 I'm afraid she's in a meeting at the moment . Who's speaking ? __eou__  This is John Laing from Dantons . __eou__
 OK , I'll get someone to phone you first thing in the morning . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  Could you tell him that Horst Weissmuller phoned . __eou__
 OK , will do . Bye . __eou__  Thanks . Bye . __eou__
 Yes , I did . I have them here . __eou__  Keep them until you ready to give me the application and you can turn them all in at once . __eou__
 OK , OK ! __eou__  Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ? __eou__
 Glad to . The Fair is a big gathering taking place twice a year , thousands of businessmen from more than a hundred and fifty countries and regions are here to trade with China . __eou__  What about your company ? __eou__
 Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets . __eou__  I'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow . __eou__
 Why , of course . Here are some that will show you our latest development . You may select which ever you need . __eou__  I think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high , compared with those of other supplies . __eou__
 Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful . __eou__  Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age . __eou__
 I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it . __eou__  Good luck to us . __eou__
 Thank you for your instruction . I really need to know the rules before I play the game , so I can know more about our company . __eou__  The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company . __eou__
 Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . __eou__  This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction . __eou__
 If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . __eou__  Then what ’ s your counter-offer ? __eou__
 I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . __eou__  Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? __eou__
 We've already cut down our price to cost level . __eou__  Is that all ? __eou__
 Yes , this is the best we can do . __eou__  I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered . __eou__
 Sounds good . I will do it in a jiffy . OK ! Let's put our heads together . __eou__  You said it . We can also find some helpful advice from some experts . __eou__
 YOU GET ME ! __eou__  All the fears are nothing . You can make it . There is no other choice for you . Be brave . __eou__
 Seemingly there is no turning back . I have to face it somehow . __eou__  It's all or nothing . __eou__
 I'd like to have rest , but I have many things to do . __eou__  How about this post-trip ? __eou__
 OK , it's no problem . __eou__  ( Afternoon ) Miss Liu . Are you typing my report ? __eou__
 OK , please don't worry about it . You should set your mind at rest . __eou__  Ha , I know you are great secretary . __eou__
 All right . Good-bye . __eou__  Good-bye . __eou__
 Of course . I've arranged it at 10 0 ' clock tomorrow morning . __eou__  Well , shall we get down to business ' . __eou__
 I'm very glad to hear that . __eou__  What's your best price for that item ? __eou__
 I'm afraid we can't . $ 12.50 is our rock bottom price . If you purchase more than 10,000 units we can reduce it to $ 12.00 . __eou__  Well , I'll accept the price and place an initial order of 10,000 units . __eou__
 Very good . It's been a pleasure to do business with you , Mr . Smith . __eou__  The pleasure is ours . Can you deliver the goods by March 31 ? __eou__
 Sorry , Mr . Smith agenda is full today . __eou__  How about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__
 I am afraid that is not acceptable . Your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent . __eou__  Well . I will tell you what , Mr . Li . I will review the contract and talk with management . Then we will get together and hash this out . __eou__
 All right , as a token of friendship , we accept your counter-offer . __eou__  I'm glad that we've settled the price . __eou__
 We think the price is too high . __eou__  That's the best price we can offer . __eou__
 Yes , we have the free samples for customers . And you can have a try . __eou__  Thank you . We'll order once we try the sample . __eou__
 I'll certainly look into that . __eou__  Thank you . Goodbye . __eou__
 Thanks , Mr . Liang . __eou__  Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus . __eou__
 Really ? I am too happy . __eou__  I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too . __eou__
 Very agreeable , Mr . Smith . It will only take me a minute to sign it and send it back to you . __eou__  Good . Let's shake hands on this successful transaction . __eou__
 Come in , please . __eou__  Hello , Mr . Liang . I've done with the work . My report is here so please give me new instructions . __eou__
 Thank you for inquiring . But your enquiry is too vague to reply . __eou__  Please send us your best offer and state payment terms and time of shipment . __eou__
 Of course not . My school record was above average in my class . __eou__  Very good . What was your favorite subject in middle school ? __eou__
 Yes , I will . __eou__  Good . Can you please also list all the documents in those old files ? __eou__
 We're sure we will . And welcome to our corporation next year . We're expecting you . __eou__  Ok ! We'll definitely go to visit your company . __eou__
 That'll cost me a fortune . __eou__  Don't worry about that . I'll reimburse you as soon as I receive the package . __eou__
 OK ! I'll tell him . __eou__  And Mr . Green will make another appointment when Mr . Wang comes back . __eou__
 Ok ! Thanks for calling . __eou__  Bye ! __eou__
 Sure , what's wrong ? __eou__  I want to create a password for this document . Please tell me how to do it . __eou__
 OK ! __eou__  Let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back . __eou__
 Thanks ! __eou__  How was your flight ? __eou__
 Well , if you can meet our deadline . __eou__  That shouldn't be a problem , as long as we can make ends meet . __eou__
 We never fail to meet our client's expectation . __eou__  Excellent . We will meet all your conditions if you can meet our demands . __eou__
 That's OK ! We'll take you to have a tour . Please follow me . __eou__  How many shifts are there in your factory ? __eou__
 I'm sorry . The agreement hasn't been fully prepared . It will be ready by tomorrow . __eou__  Can you speed it up and let us have it today ? __eou__
 All right . __eou__  Shall we sign the agreement now ? __eou__
 We are sure to responsible to replace the defective ones . __eou__  That's great . __eou__
 OK , no problem . I hope there are no questions about the terms . __eou__  I am fully satisfied with the terms of this contract . __eou__
 OK . ( Sign ) Once a contract is signed , it has legal effect . __eou__  You're right . Thank you for your cooperation . __eou__
 OK , thank you very much . __eou__  Not at all . That's what I should do . __eou__
 Fine . I have your letter and I've made some notes . __eou__  How can I find out what countries to invest ? __eou__
 If you think it is necessary . __eou__  It's just our policy . We would accept a certified check or a direct bank remittance . __eou__
 I should be most delighted . __eou__  Thank you , Mr . White . __eou__
 OK ! We'll see it . __eou__  What kind of guarantee are you going to provide for us ? __eou__
 OK ! We will . Bye ! __eou__  Bye ! __eou__
 I'm afraid that's impossible . You can't expect us to reduce it to that extent . __eou__  I think you are well informed about the prevailing market.Some Spanish firms are offering the same at much lower prices . __eou__
 Price can't be separated from quality . A comparison of the quality of our products with that of rival goods will show you that ours is far superior . __eou__  It's true yours are of better quality . But your price is still on the high side even if we take quality into consideration . How about meeting each other half way ? __eou__
 That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need . __eou__  And please let white color dominate . __eou__
 OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ? __eou__  Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city . __eou__
 I'll tell them . __eou__  Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . __eou__
 Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery . __eou__  Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you . __eou__
 That's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . Any other ideas ? __eou__  I don't think I can change it right now . Why don't we talk again tomorrow ? __eou__
 Sure . I have to talk to my office anyway . I hope we can find some common ground on this . __eou__  Robert , I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else . __eou__
 I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground . __eou__  I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % . __eou__
 Dana . I can't bring those numbers back to my office , they'll turn it down flat . __eou__  Then you'll have to think of something better , Robert . __eou__
 I need to think it over . __eou__  Tell me what you need . __eou__
 I am all ears . __eou__  First , can I know something about your financial situations ? __eou__
 Sure , please hold on . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 I'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . __eou__  Don't you agree with me that in the long run moderate prices we bring about large sales and more profit ? __eou__
 We've already cut down our price to cost level . __eou__  Is that all ? __eou__
 Yes this is the best we can do . __eou__  I'm sorry , we can't handle the price you offered . __eou__
 That's OK . __eou__  The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . __eou__
 That's a good idea . __eou__  First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . __eou__
 Agreed . __eou__  For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . __eou__
 That's a lot to sell with very low profit margins . __eou__  It's about the best we can do , Smith . We need to hammer something out today . If I go back empty-handed , I may be coming back to you soon to ask for a job . __eou__
 I can agree to that . Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . __eou__  Tom , this deal promises big returns for both sides . Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . __eou__
 Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it . __eou__  Why ? This is a fair market price . __eou__
 But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value . __eou__  I wish you could make a reconsideration . If you don't reduce your price , we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  Your resume says you worked at DK Company for two years . What were you responsible for ? __eou__
 Certainly . __eou__  What is the tariff ? __eou__
 Yes , sir . Will there be anything else ? __eou__  No , thank you . That will be all for now . __eou__
 All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set . __eou__  Very well . Thank you . __eou__
 I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . __eou__  I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . __eou__
 That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . __eou__  What's your counter-offer then ? __eou__
 15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . __eou__  If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . __eou__
 If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . __eou__  How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . __eou__
 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . __eou__  Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further . __eou__
 Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . __eou__  This is our rock-bottom price and we can't make any further reduction . __eou__
 If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . __eou__  Then , what's your countr-offer ? __eou__
 Your desire coincides with ours . __eou__  Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to our bank.or to our local chamber of commerce or inquiry agencies . __eou__
 So do I . __eou__  I hope everything will be smooth . __eou__
 That is what I want to say . __eou__  I will give you the lowest price in the future . __eou__
 Cancelled ? That's just can't happen ! __eou__  Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday . __eou__
 We also hope to expand our business with you . __eou__  This is our common desire . __eou__
 Right . Seeing is believing . __eou__  Sure . __eou__

 I will try my best to assist you if you need any help . __eou__  Thank you . It is very kind of you . __eou__
 I'm afraid I can't discuss that over the phone . __eou__  So you're a headhunter . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  Buy a decent suit . __eou__
 Thank you , Miss Kelly . __eou__  What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ? __eou__
 Because we're partners . __eou__  I realize that but I needed to make a decision . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I'm looking for Bob . __eou__
John , do you have a minute ? __eou__  Oh , hi , Leo . Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__
 Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office . __eou__  But I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work . __eou__
 We really can ’ t ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ? __eou__  No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you . __eou__
 How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? __eou__  Oh , that would be too small . __eou__
 With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . __eou__  Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . __eou__
 Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . __eou__  Let's rock n ' roll . __eou__
Mrs . Phoebe , here are your ordered goods . Please inspect the goods now . __eou__  All right . Let me have a check . Can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ? __eou__
 That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes . __eou__  I realize that now . I will do that after a while . __eou__
 Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ? __eou__  Of course , let me help you . __eou__
 Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons . __eou__  OK . We will manage it later . __eou__
Hello , Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ? __eou__  I'm Mr . Stephen's secretary . He has an appointment with Mr . Green today . __eou__
 I'm afraid we have to reschedule it . __eou__  Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ? __eou__
 I'm very sorry . But Mr . Stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away . __eou__  How about Friday afternoon ? __eou__
 How about Friday afternoon ? __eou__  That will be fine . __eou__
 Maybe his phone is out of order . Anyway , keep working on it . I really need an answer about the contract I sent him . __eou__  All right , I'll let you know when I get through . __eou__
Linda , it's really late . Let's call it a day . __eou__  Good idea . We can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning . __eou__
 Sure thing . Do you want me to give you a ride home ? __eou__  That ’ s great . Thanks for the ride . I really appreciate 1 it . You know my car is still in the shop . __eou__
 Please feel free to stay as long as you want . You know you ’ re always welcome here . __eou__  Thank you . You ’ Ve been so nice to me . __eou__
 Is there anything else I can do for you before your leave ? __eou__  No , thanks . You ’ Ve done a lot for me already . Thank you for everything . __eou__
 Yes . Let's first define the inspection right . __eou__  Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival . __eou__
 Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ? __eou__  Inspection is to be done by the China Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau . Usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment . __eou__
 And can you tell me about the re-inspection ? __eou__  Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month . __eou__
 That's true . You need to take some time off to relax . __eou__  You said it . I'm looking forward to my annual vacation . __eou__
 Will you give me some suggestion ? __eou__  Of course , such as Alabama , which is a famous website . __eou__
Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . __eou__  We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate . __eou__
 That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase . __eou__  Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ? __eou__
 I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales . __eou__  Well , we'll consider your proposal . __eou__
 Good . One more thing , we'd like you to quote us on CIF basis . __eou__  Okay . No problem . __eou__
 Let's look at that another way . The major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . __eou__  What are you thinking about ? __eou__
 I wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection . __eou__  I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__
 But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ? __eou__  I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up . __eou__
 To be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That will tie up my money and add to my cost . __eou__  Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__
I am here to get my prescription filled . __eou__  Your prescription will be ready in twenty minutes . __eou__
 Your prescription will be ready in twenty minutes . __eou__  Do you ever deliver prescriptions by mail ? __eou__

I am dropping off my prescription to get it filled . __eou__  You can come back in twenty minutes , and it will be ready . __eou__

 You need to take it at bedtime . __eou__  Should I take this medicine on an empty stomach ? __eou__
 Don ’ t mix alcohol with this medication , but you can take it with or without food . __eou__  What are the side effects of this medication ? __eou__
Excuse me , could you help me pick out a lotion ? __eou__  Sure , what is the problem ? __eou__
 I got poison oak while hiking , and I need something to help me with the itching . __eou__  I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream . __eou__
 I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream . __eou__  Which do you prefer ? __eou__
 Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer . __eou__  Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ? __eou__

I need help picking out a lotion . __eou__  It would be my pleasure to help you . What do you need help with ? __eou__
 I picked up some poison oak while hiking , and I can ’ t stop itching . __eou__  We have Techne , and it is available in lotion or cream . __eou__
 If you take an antihistamine , that would help a lot . __eou__  Thank you for helping me figure out what to do with my poison oak . __eou__
I was told to come to you to get a chest X-ray . __eou__  No problem . Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put the gown on , with the opening in the back . __eou__
 No problem . Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put the gown on , with the opening in the back . __eou__  Then what should I do ? __eou__
 You will stand over here up against this plate . __eou__  Should I just stand naturally ? __eou__
 You will raise your arms up shoulder high . __eou__  Is this all right ? __eou__
 Yes , you are doing great . __eou__  Where will you be going ? __eou__
 I need to stand behind this shield . Now you will take a deep breath , hold it , and let it out . __eou__  Is that it ? __eou__

 I am not leaving . I just need you to take a really deep breath , hold it , and then let it out . __eou__  Will I be finished then ? __eou__
 Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ? __eou__  It seems to me like I may have caught a bug . __eou__
My doctor said that I need a chest X-ray . __eou__  Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on , with the opening in the back . __eou__
 Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on , with the opening in the back . __eou__  What should I do after that ? __eou__
 You need to come over here and face this plate . __eou__  Am I standing the right way ? __eou__
 I will need your arms raised to shoulder height . __eou__  Am I doing this the right way ? __eou__
 I am just getting behind this screen . You need to take a deep breath , hold it , and then breathe normally . __eou__  Is that all there is to it ? __eou__
 I think that rest and liquids are what doctors recommend for a cold . __eou__  My grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold . __eou__
 A pharmacist might be able to help you if your home remedies don ’ t work . __eou__  Yes , if I get worse , I will definitely look for extra help with this . __eou__
 I have some cold tablets if you would like one . __eou__  Mostly , I feel like I need some rest and hot soup . __eou__
 Drinking liquids and getting rest is a good idea with a cold . __eou__  My grandmother thinks that honey and whiskey is a good cure for a cold . __eou__
 My grandmother thinks that honey and whiskey is a good cure for a cold . __eou__  You could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions . __eou__
 You could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions . __eou__  If things don ’ t get better in a few days , I will look for some other solutions . __eou__
Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? __eou__  Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . __eou__
 Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . __eou__  I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? __eou__
 One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! __eou__  When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? __eou__
 You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important thing is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend the __eou__  What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? __eou__
 One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out side of your body . __eou__  So I need plenty of space for this exercise . __eou__
 Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . __eou__  Great . Thanks for you advice ! __eou__
 well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good . __eou__  yes , he is . I ’ Ve make an appointment for 10 o ’ clock , so I ’ d better move along . __eou__

 We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . __eou__  I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . __eou__

 Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . __eou__  There . Stop ! __eou__

 Yes , I need to refill it today . __eou__  Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . __eou__
 Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . __eou__  Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? __eou__
 Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? __eou__  I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . __eou__
 But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . __eou__  Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . __eou__
 But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . __eou__  A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . __eou__
 Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . __eou__  Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . __eou__
 Yes , I am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam . __eou__  We are basically going to check your heart , lungs , blood sugar levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . __eou__
 We are basically going to check your heart , lungs , blood sugar levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . __eou__  I ’ Ve being kind of been having problems being out of breath . Can you look at that ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve being kind of been having problems being out of breath . Can you look at that ? __eou__  Yes , I will check you for asthma , and maybe we can check you for allergies later . __eou__

 No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly . __eou__  I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room . __eou__
 Let me see a doctor . __eou__  I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 . __eou__
 I thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up . __eou__  Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year . __eou__
 Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year . __eou__  I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? __eou__
 Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . __eou__  O . K . __eou__
 Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . __eou__  I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit . __eou__
 Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave . __eou__  O . K . , thanks , doctor . __eou__

 It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . __eou__  C'mon . Just don't move . __eou__
 Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! __eou__  There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . __eou__
 There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . __eou__  Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . __eou__
 Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . __eou__  Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . __eou__
 No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . __eou__  Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? __eou__
My wife is in labor ! __eou__  Here , Ma ’ am please get on the stretcher . __eou__

Finally , I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless . . . just to clear up your lungs ! __eou__  Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ? __eou__
 Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don ’ t get weak and dehydrated . You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies ! __eou__  Ok ! Would you mind writing me a doctor ’ s note for work , otherwise they may think I am faking it ! __eou__

 I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery . You look amazing . __eou__  I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . __eou__

 Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . __eou__  Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . __eou__
 Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . __eou__  Thanks doc ! __eou__
 Do you have your medical history sheet with you ? __eou__  Yes , here you are . __eou__

 Oh , well that ’ s okay , I ’ ll get some later , thanks ... Really it ’ s no problem . __eou__  Just hang on there a sec . Can I get a price check on ” Fun Times Ribbed Condoms ” please ! __eou__
 Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision . __eou__  Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . __eou__

 Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . __eou__  Thanks doc ! __eou__
 Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . __eou__  Is it gonna hurt ? __eou__
 No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . __eou__  Ok , spit . __eou__
Please point out the painful place with your finger . Is there any relation between the pain and the weather ? __eou__  Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes intense when I walk too much . __eou__
 I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree . __eou__  By the way , does acupuncture hurt ? __eou__
 Acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . We'll try it every day for seven days . Will that be all right ? __eou__  Yes . Let's start today . __eou__
Doctor , I feel much better now . Will I be albe to go home some time this week ? __eou__  That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow . __eou__
 That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow . __eou__  Do you think I can get back to work very soon ? __eou__
 Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks . __eou__  Is there anything I should do ? __eou__
 You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while . __eou__  Should I take some medicine ? __eou__
 Should I take some medicine ? __eou__  Yes . I'm going to give you some . Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the outpatient department for a consultation in two weeks , please . __eou__

 Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken . __eou__  What if it's broken ? __eou__
 Then we'll put you in a cast . __eou__  What do you mean by a cast ? __eou__
 Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can telling me which way the “ E ” points . __eou__  All right . __eou__
 Good . Now the other eye . __eou__  Well , this one is worse . __eou__
 Never mind , just read as far as you can . __eou__  I can only read the first three lines . __eou__
 Well , let me have a look . Will you sit down in this chair and open your mouth wide ? __eou__  I think one of the back ones at the top is giving me the most trouble . __eou__
 I think one of the back ones at the top is giving me the most trouble . __eou__  Yes . This big one is badly decayed . I'm afraid it must be taken out . __eou__
 Yes . This big one is badly decayed . I'm afraid it must be taken out . __eou__  Oh , I hate having teeth pulled out . Will it hurt ? __eou__
 No need to worry . You won't feel anything at all . I'll give you an injection to stop the pain . Just wash your mouth out with this water , will you ? __eou__  Will it take long ? __eou__
 No , it'll be over soon . Nurse , get some X-rays of our patient's molars . Then we'll start . Open your mouth wide . Don't be so nervous . Now open wider ... now stay , that's over ... __eou__  Is it out ? __eou__
 Not yet , but it soon will be . Now open again please ... It's out ! Look ! __eou__  Well , really ! That was wonderful ! I felt no pain at all . Thank you , doctor . __eou__
 OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis . __eou__  What useful treatment can you offer ? __eou__
 Let me take a look at your abdomen . Lie down on your back and bend your knees up . OK . relax ... Alright , it seems like you have a duodenal ulcer , but we'll have to run some tests before I can be certain . You should get a good rest first and try not to strain your stomach too much . __eou__  Is it serious ? __eou__
 Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ? __eou__  Will I need stitches ? __eou__

 I ’ m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out . __eou__  Then I might as well have it done now . __eou__
 Hi . My name's David Johnson . I'd like to make an appointment . __eou__  All right , David . Is this for a checkup or a cleaning ? __eou__
 A checkup . I think I have a bad cavity . Half the side of my head hurts . __eou__  What tooth is giving you pain ? __eou__
 Good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest . __eou__  OK . I can afford to take a few days off work . __eou__
 Don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . If I were you , I ’ d just sleep , read a book , or watch TV . Here is your prescription . __eou__  Thanks doctor . I ’ ll get these immediately . Goodbye . __eou__
 Here , sir , sit down in this wheelchair . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 It sounds like you ’ re coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature . __eou__  Have I got high fever ? __eou__
 Now , Let me have a look at you . I ’ d like to listen to your chest . Breathe then , deep breath , that ’ s it . Cough , now again . I want to exam your throat too . Open wide , say A . __eou__  ah . __eou__
 Yes , It does look a bit sore.Let ’ s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests . __eou__  All right , thanks . __eou__
 Oh , In what way . __eou__  No appetite , always unaged and I can ’ t sleep well . __eou__
 Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr.Brown . I ’ m happy to say it ’ s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork . __eou__  What am I suppose to do ? __eou__
 I think you ’ ll needs just vacation . Try to get out doors more . I ’ ll be sure if you get more rest . __eou__  Thank you , doctor . I ’ ll do what you say . __eou__
 Yes , I see . Go home to bed and take one of these pills every three hours . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning . __eou__  Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ? __eou__
 The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic . __eou__  Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ? __eou__
 The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out . __eou__  Thank you ! __eou__
 Here , sir . Sit down in this wheel chair . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions . __eou__  All right . __eou__
 Unbutton your shirt , please . __eou__  Well , doctor ? __eou__
 You'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure . __eou__  What examinations ? __eou__
Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas . __eou__  Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? __eou__
 OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . __eou__  That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . __eou__
 That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . __eou__  Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider . __eou__
Mr . Chen , I have a Marry from realty world on line one . __eou__  I don't have time to talk to her now . __eou__
 OK , I'll take a message . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
Mr . Wilson . We very regret the mistakes in goods . I am very sorry and we are responsible for the mistake . __eou__  We have no choice but to hold you responsible for the loss we sustained . __eou__
 The first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation . About the second problem , I admit it's our fault , so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample . __eou__  Well . I hope there won't be such things . __eou__
How about overtime work ? __eou__  Overtime work is very common in companies . I can work overtime if it's necessary , but I don ’ t think we will work overtime everyday . __eou__
 I ’ m calling to offer you the position of computer engineer . __eou__  May I ask how much I can get every month ? __eou__
 I thought the starting salary is too low . __eou__  What is the lowest salary you may consider ? __eou__
 I hope to make 4,000 yuan a month for supporting my family . __eou__  That ’ s all right . We will pay you 4 , 000 yuan a month for supporting your family . Would you like to start on next Monday ? __eou__
 I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . __eou__  Thank you . Miss Kelly . __eou__
 Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ? __eou__  Yes , I would . ( After testing ) __eou__
 Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? __eou__  Yes , I'd like to give it a try . __eou__
 Well , maybe the net is slow now . Try it again . __eou__  I am used to editing with Word 2003 , and there are many pictures in the book . __eou__
 It's beyond question . You can save it the same as a document . __eou__  I merely know how to send the direct letter . But I am not familiar with the attachment . __eou__
 It's the same as usual . The only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment . __eou__  Can I mail the book if it is a large file ? __eou__
 There are limitations to the capacity of an E-mail . Commonly it's no more than 4 MB . __eou__  What if it exceeds the capacity ? __eou__
 We have made the decision to hire you . __eou__  Wonderful . Thank you very much . I have been dreaming to work with your company and I am finally granted the great opportunity . I won ’ t let you down and I hope you will contact me when you have any questions . __eou__
Hello , Could you please connect me to Mr . Cook's office ? It is on Line Three . __eou__  I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension number . __eou__
 Oh . Then I don't know what his number is . Can you check it for me ? __eou__  OK . Hold on , please . __eou__
 Mr.Cook is on Line Six . I'll put you through . __eou__  Thank you . You helped me a lot . __eou__
 It's my honor , Mr . Mike . By the way , how can I know whether I am accepted or not ? __eou__  We hope to make a decision in the next few days . We'll notify you of our decision by mail , is this convenient for you ? __eou__
 We hope to make a decision in the next few days . We'll notify you of our decision by mail , is this convenient for you ? __eou__  Yes . Thank you very much . I am looking forward to hearing from you . __eou__
Can I talk to you for a moment , manager ? __eou__  Yes , of course . What is it ? __eou__
 I've decided to leave . __eou__  Leave ? Why ? __eou__
 I've worked here for two years . And I want to do something different . __eou__  What do you mean by something different ? __eou__
 Sorry , Tom , can you say that last bit again please ? We didn ’ t get that . __eou__  Oh , OK , I said ( XXXXXXXXXX ) on time . __eou__
 Tom , if you can hear me , I think we ’ Ve lost you . There ’ s a problem with the line . Let ’ s try again . We ’ ll call you . __eou__  ( XXXXXXXXXX ) OK ( XXXXXXXXXX ) . __eou__
We have received your resume in answer to our ads . I would like to talk with you regarding your qualification for this position , OK ? __eou__  It is my honor to have this chance for this interview . Well , my major is commercial English . You know , and I am not only familiar with useful English expressions in business , but also learn some theories on this field . Besides , during my college learning period , I also attended some commercial activities to strive for the opportunity of practicing what I learned . __eou__
 Couldn't you raise the commission to five percent ? __eou__  Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ? __eou__
 Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ? __eou__  Then I'll accept it with thanks . __eou__
Good morning , Janice . Our office will hold a welcoming party in the evening , so I will allocate you some assignment . __eou__  Is that difficult ? __eou__
 Don't worry . I will find someone to assist you . __eou__  That's all right . What can I do ? __eou__
 Firstly , you should go to the supermarket , which is nearest to our company , to buy some fruit , drinks , desserts and cakes . Here is the list of things you need to buy . __eou__  Well . I can do it . And then ? __eou__
 Who will pay for these things ? __eou__  Don't worry about that . I have already calculated the money about things you will buy . Remember to give me the receipt when you come back . __eou__
 As a new-comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . And remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave . __eou__  Will our company have some recreational activities ? __eou__
Now let me tell you your definite duties in this office and this is your desk . Please sit down . __eou__  I see . Thank you . Sir , what kind of duties will I do ? __eou__
 B , your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them . Is that difficult ? __eou__  It's easy . Is there anything I can do for you , sir ? __eou__
 Well . I have nearly forgotten . Mr Green from ABC Company had an appointment with me , but I will be very busy at that time . If he calls , you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week . __eou__  I will leave a memo for you , sir . __eou__
Can you ship this batch of cotton within five or six weeks ? __eou__  What kind of cottons are they ? May I see your list ? Ah , machine prints . __eou__
 We could manage the plain rolls in six weeks . The prints might be put off to eight weeks . __eou__  Eight weeks ? We can wait that long . __eou__
 That's the best we can do just now , I'm afraid . __eou__  Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ? __eou__
 Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ? __eou__  What about taking the prints in two shipments ? Two thousand rolls in seven weeks , and the remained a week later . __eou__
 What about taking the prints in two shipments ? Two thousand rolls in seven weeks , and the remained a week later . __eou__  That might be acceptable . I shall have to cable our Beijing office to get their approval . You can definitely supply in the time you've given me , I suppose . __eou__
 That might be acceptable . I shall have to cable our Beijing office to get their approval . You can definitely supply in the time you've given me , I suppose . __eou__  Yes , I'll see that you get those delivery . Shipping by ' S . S . American ' as usual , is that all right ? __eou__
 Yes , I'll see that you get those delivery . Shipping by ' S . S . American ' as usual , is that all right ? __eou__  That's right . __eou__
 As soon as I hear from Beijing , that will be either Friday or Saturday . __eou__  All right . __eou__
These goods can be broken very easily , so we would be thankful if you would be sure to use durable packing materials . __eou__  That will be no problem . We never use any kind of inferior packaging . Your goods will be safe . __eou__
 Good . Can we ask you to put a country of origin mark on each container ? __eou__  We always do that , but I will make a point to check it for you since it is so important . __eou__
 Do you always put a quality mark on each container ? For this shipment it is crucial to us that you do . __eou__  We don't usually do that unless we are asked to . I'lI tell my staff to take care of this for you . __eou__
 Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof . __eou__  In that case , I guess I can rest assured . __eou__
 Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too . __eou__  You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ? __eou__
 You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ? __eou__  We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher . __eou__
 It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? Let's still use cartons . __eou__  Sure , no problem . As I said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . You don't have to worry about it . __eou__
Could I have a word with you , Madam ? __eou__  Is that you , Janice ? Just speaking . __eou__
 Is that you , Janice ? Just speaking . __eou__  I have to tell you that I can't be in today and tomorrow . __eou__
 Is that serious ? You ought to see a doctor . __eou__  Yes , I did this in the morning . And my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days . __eou__
 I hope so . And I will definitely tell you if I can not . __eou__  Well , take care of yourself . And hope you will be better as soon as possible . __eou__
Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms . __eou__  I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents . __eou__
 I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents . __eou__  I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ? __eou__
 I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ? __eou__  I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C . __eou__
 But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem . __eou__  I understand that . Still , I'm not in a position to help you . Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together . __eou__
Can you effect shipment during September ? __eou__  I don't think we can make it . __eou__
 It's too late . You see , in our market October is the season for the kind of commodity . So the goods must be shipped before October or we won't be ready for the season . __eou__  Well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we'll try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery . __eou__
 Well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we'll try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery . __eou__  Thanks . Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on September 15 or earlier ' ? __eou__
 Thanks . Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on September 15 or earlier ' ? __eou__  Let me see . Now the workers will have to work on three shifts for it . Well , we can manage it on 20th September . That's the best we can do . __eou__
 Let me see . Now the workers will have to work on three shifts for it . Well , we can manage it on 20th September . That's the best we can do . __eou__  Oh , that's very considerate of you . I'lI take your word for it . __eou__
Sir , I want to ask for a leave for five days . Here is the request form . __eou__  Let me see your form . You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year , right ? __eou__
 Let me see your form . You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year , right ? __eou__  Yes , I need to go home to have a family reunion . __eou__
 Yes , I need to go home to have a family reunion . __eou__  Do you still remember we already have a New Year celebration on January 1st ? __eou__
 Yes , sir . I remember it . But our Chinese usually celebrate the New Year on lunar calendar . __eou__  Well , I understand that . Your request is approved . Remember to give my best regards to your parents . __eou__
 Because this order is a comparatively big one , we would like to pay by time L / C , say , 60 days L / C . __eou__  Payment by sight L / C is quite usual in international trade , and as a rule , we only accept payment by sight L / C . __eou__
 But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it . __eou__  Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before , but we could consider your request . I'll phone our company to see what they say . __eou__
 Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before , but we could consider your request . I'll phone our company to see what they say . __eou__  Thank you for your consideration . When will you let me know your answer ? __eou__
 We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible . __eou__  I also realized this issue . And office automation is essential . __eou__
 Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age . __eou__  Good idea . A network of work stations is helpful for our management . __eou__
 And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function . __eou__  You are right . The current equipment of our offices really falls behind . Next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment . __eou__
 We can have a rest now after this tough interview . __eou__  Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company . __eou__
 Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company . __eou__  Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ? __eou__
 Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you . __eou__  I am getting to know your meaning . __eou__
Could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? I am going to receive some urgent fax from a company . __eou__  Of course . Let me check it . Firstly , don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it . __eou__
 Of course . Let me check it . Firstly , don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it . __eou__  That's right . __eou__
 After overcoming these buttons , you should check whether there is any paper in the machine , you must make sure this . __eou__  I couldn't agree more . __eou__
 And then prepare what you want to receive . If you want to send a photograph , you must copy one . __eou__  What can I do next ? __eou__
 The next thing you should do is to wait . The sender will give you the fax . __eou__  Look . Some of the faxes come through blurred . What is wrong with it ? __eou__
 We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots . __eou__  When do you want to deliver the goods ? __eou__
 We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 . __eou__  I'm sorry , but June 30 is quite soon . I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but June 30 is quite soon . I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases . __eou__  I can agree to that . __eou__
 OK , let me hear it . I'd be glad to help if I can . __eou__  Good . I want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation . __eou__
 Good . I want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation . __eou__  Well , I trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms . __eou__
 Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? __eou__  Yes . But the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks . __eou__
 So , we propose your company apply to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for a long-term loan . Six months before each shipment , you through Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation open , in our favour , an irrevocable , dividable L / C which is to remain valid for two months . __eou__  Well , we accept your suggestion . __eou__
I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . __eou__  It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . __eou__
 What about a draft at 120 days sight ? __eou__  All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . __eou__
 All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . __eou__  A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . __eou__
 Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . __eou__  I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . __eou__
 We are not interested in small orders . I suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen . __eou__  No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ? __eou__
 No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ? __eou__  Yes , of course . We have enough productivity . You can rest assured . __eou__
 And for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount . __eou__  Sure , we can reduce our price by ten percent . __eou__
We like your product , and are interested in placing an order with you as soon as possible . __eou__  Well , we can proceed with the order until after the Christmas holidays . Our factories will be closed for another week . __eou__
 Well , we can proceed with the order until after the Christmas holidays . Our factories will be closed for another week . __eou__  That's all right . We will send you a purchase order in one week . I hope you will be able to take care of it . __eou__
 That's all right . We will send you a purchase order in one week . I hope you will be able to take care of it . __eou__  No problem . Once we get your purchase order , we will begin the execution of the order right away . __eou__
 Thanks . We need the products in less than one month , because we have a big deal with another company . By the way , will payment against delivery be OK ? __eou__  That will be fine . And I can promise you that you'll get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order . __eou__
We will carry out the order when the purchase order gets here . __eou__  Good . And because this is our initial order , and your products is so new , we would like to make a deal with you . __eou__
 Good . And because this is our initial order , and your products is so new , we would like to make a deal with you . __eou__  Well , actually in most cases we don't talk about special deals , but since this one is so new I will listen to what you have to say . __eou__
 We want to make this a trial order . If we can sell all the products in two months , we will pay for them ; if not , we will send them back to you . __eou__  I can't agree to that . My company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back . __eou__
 We promise that if the products are sold out in two months , we will place a repeat order right away , at the same quality . __eou__  OK , I agree . But the repeat order can't have the same terms . __eou__
 Congratulations ! Let's get together sometime . __eou__  Great idea . __eou__
 Let it be ! Time will tell . __eou__  Maybe they will send me e-mail to inform the result . Let me check my mail-box again . __eou__
 Well , please look at the employment contract . I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved . __eou__  Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ? __eou__
 Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ? __eou__  Of course . A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ? __eou__
Steven , have a rest . Could you have a talk with me ? __eou__  OK ! What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__
 OK ! What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__  Janice has just got sick and I need a hand now . Could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ? __eou__
 Janice has just got sick and I need a hand now . Could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ? __eou__  When do you want me to come ? __eou__
 Let me think . About half past seven if it is okay for you . __eou__  That's fine . I can make it . __eou__
Fred , is it a good time to talk with you ? __eou__  Sure , what's the matter ? __eou__
 We are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . So , to be honest , I want you to help me to finish all these programs . __eou__  Well , sir , I am busy in market development . So I am worried whether I can do this . __eou__
 I am aware you have been working so hard . Before hiring more employees , you are still needed to do this . __eou__  OK ! I will try this . __eou__
 Nice to meet you . My name is Tyler Smith . Let's go to your office desk , follow me please . __eou__  OK . __eou__
 Here is your working place . Nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones . I'm going to call her now so that you can get started . Is that OK ? __eou__  Yes , that's OK . I'm glad to get started . __eou__
 If you have any further questions , just ask me . __eou__  OK . Thank you very much . __eou__
 OK , that's all . We'll inform you in two days . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
My pal , you are so nervous recently . You don't need to be like that . __eou__  I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . That will be embarrassing . __eou__
Stephen , can you work overtime tonight ? __eou__  What's wrong ? We have been working overtime recently . __eou__
 The holiday is coming so we need to finish our task . __eou__  Must we finish our task before the holiday ? __eou__
 Don't worry . I will tell him about that . __eou__  It is convenient for me to work overtime tonight . __eou__
 Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . __eou__  So how do you intend to do that ? __eou__
 May I interrupt you for a moment ? __eou__  Go ahead . __eou__
Hello , Pineapple Computer Company . This is Janice Shaw , the secretary of Nova . May I ask who is calling ? __eou__  Good morning . This is Dan . Could I speak to Nova ? __eou__
 Good morning . This is Dan . Could I speak to Nova ? __eou__  I feel so sorry that Nova has gone on her business trip . __eou__
 Well , the reason why I am calling is to tell her that our appointment in next month will have to be postponed . And the exact time for this meeting will be discussed after she comes back . __eou__  Wait a minute . I have to leave a memo here . Anything else ? __eou__
 The file for the meeting needs to be retyped and please send it to us as soon as possible . __eou__  Dan , don't worry . I will tell her everything as soon as she comes back . __eou__
 Next week there will be a meeting with the manager of USE Company ; this is an important opportunity for our company to have a new relationship with a new partner . So , I want you to prepare an instruction book with detailed introduction of our products . This introduction will be presented in the meeting . __eou__  I get it . And ... ? __eou__
 Remember to add an agenda for this meeting and show our warm welcome to them . __eou__  How about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ? __eou__
 How about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ? __eou__  Good idea ! The pictures will illustrate the performance of our products vividly . __eou__
 A , do your best , it's very important . __eou__  Please trust me . I will finish it very well . __eou__
We should know by next month whom to hire . If your application is successful , we'll notify you by mail . __eou__  How long would I wait ? __eou__
 We'll give you our decision in 7 days . __eou__  Thank you . I hope to hear from you as soon as possible . __eou__
 Please send the next candidate in on your way out . __eou__  OK , good-bye . __eou__
Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ? __eou__  Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ? __eou__
 Well , let me check again under a different heading . __eou__  Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files . __eou__
Hello , my name is Clark . May I speak to Mr . Allen , please ? __eou__  This is Rick Allen speaking . Can I help you ? __eou__
 Mr . Allen , I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ? __eou__  We have thought of you very carefully , but the other candidate has more experience . __eou__
 Maybe you could hire me on trial , if I ’ m not qualified for this position , you can let me go . __eou__  That ’ s a good idea . __eou__
 Maybe that is true . But I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime , and I do not mind a lot of business travel . __eou__  We surely believe you . __eou__
 Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ? __eou__  I am afraid we are sticking to our choice . __eou__
 Possibly you are now . But in case you will change your mind , please let me know . __eou__  OK . __eou__
Ladies and gentlemen , dear Mr . Simpson . Following the increasing communication between Unity Company and Pineapple Computer Company , we established steady cooperation . And today we all here feel very proud and honored to have Mr . Simpson with us . Mr . Simpson is well-known for his success and his career . So first of all , let me , on the behalf of all present here , extend our warm welcome and cordial greetings to our distinguished guest . Now let's invite Mr . Simpson to give us his speech . __eou__  I want to show my gratitude for your hospitality . And I believe me trip here will be meaningful and our cooperation will go deeper and stabler in near future . Through the communication , we can know more about each other . Thank you so much for your consideration . __eou__
 Write up the official notice in duplicate . Do not forget to put name cards and pens on the tables for our guests . __eou__  Sure . __eou__
 Hush ! The wall has ears , you know . __eou__  But , my overwork has not done yet . And it is driving me crazy . __eou__
 My boy . I give you my sympathy to you . However , this meeting is said to be extremely important , so we have to attend it . __eou__  What's the meeting for ? __eou__
 Hello , I'd like to speak to Mike please . __eou__  Hold on please . __eou__
 Hello , I'm afraid Mike's unavailable right now . He's in a meeting . Can I take a message ? __eou__  Yes , can you please let him know I called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can ? My name's Mary , and I'm calling from Happy Travel . My number is 123 456 789 . __eou__
 Sorry , could you repeat that please ? __eou__  Yes , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . Have you got that ? __eou__
 Let me read that back to you , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . I'll ask him to get back you as soon as he can . __eou__  Great . Thanks . __eou__
 Oh , don't be so sad . You can ask for a salary raise . __eou__  Bingo ! I never thought about that before . I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know . __eou__
 So you suppose you deserve a salary raise . __eou__  I know I deserve it , but I can not find a way to talk with boss about this . __eou__
 You ought to point out how valuable you are , and tell her those people who have the same situation also get the salary raise . __eou__  That sounds reasonable . __eou__
 Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency . __eou__  That's a point . It seems a little complicated . I will think about this for a while . I owe you one . After all , you give me an inspiration . __eou__
Good afternoon , Miss Tao . Please sit down . __eou__  Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Thank you very much . __eou__
 I ’ Ve read your application materials with interest . Now I want to ask you a few questions , if you don ’ t mind . __eou__  As you please . I ’ m ready . __eou__
 One week after I have submitted my resignation paper . __eou__  When you start to work , I ’ ll give you $ 3,000 a month . __eou__
 When you start to work , I ’ ll give you $ 3,000 a month . __eou__  Thank you , sir . __eou__
 Well , Mr . Zhang , you must know , what we need is a capable accountant , and we won't have enough time to tell him some other things . __eou__  Yes , madam . I know that I'll be expected , first of all , to work hard if I'm hired . __eou__
 I would like a single room with a bath for two nights . Can you help me to reserve a hotel room for me ? __eou__  Yes , Madam . __eou__
Well , if you have no further questions , then we have done . __eou__  Thank you , Mr . Owens , for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me . __eou__
 Thanks a lot ! I will look forward to the good news . Please call me at this number between nine and eleven in the morning . __eou__  Well , I really appreciate your coming today . __eou__
 Yes , I've brought a list of your recent products with me . We'd like to import some of your latest clothes for the second half of this year . We're ready to place an order with you . __eou__  Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery . __eou__
 Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery . __eou__  That sounds good . But I have a proposal now . __eou__
 That sounds good . But I have a proposal now . __eou__  What's the proposal ? __eou__
 Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ? __eou__  Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided . __eou__
 No , you don ’ t . My name is Liu Lili . I got the information from the TV that your department wants to hire a clerk , who will work under you . I would like to apply for the job . __eou__  Oh , yes . We do have such a commercial . Sit down , please , Miss Liu . I ’ m glad to see you . Could you tell me about yourself first ? __eou__
 Oh , yes . We do have such a commercial . Sit down , please , Miss Liu . I ’ m glad to see you . Could you tell me about yourself first ? __eou__  OK . I ’ m 24 this year . I earned my college diploma from the Night College of Foreign Languages Institute in 2010 . My major is English . Recently I ’ Ve also earned my degree in Secretarial Technology . __eou__
 Well , according to your experience , perhaps you could tell me what essential qualities a personnel department office clerk should maintain . __eou__  Of course . First of all , she must have a strong sense of responsibility . __eou__
 Good . Go on , please . __eou__  She must be an honest person . __eou__
 Anything else ? __eou__  She must also be diligent and do a lot of things on her own initiative . __eou__
 I am so honored to hear that . Well , after staying here for several days , you must have some ideas about our company . We have been in the clothes field for many years , and yours brand is also well-known in the country . How about our cooperation ? __eou__  That is one of reasons why I am here now . I am really willing to have some cooperation with your company . __eou__
Thank you for your interest in this job . You'll be hearing from us . Send the next applicant in on your way out , please . __eou__  Thank you very much for offering me this opportunity . __eou__
 May I call you at your home about our final decision ? __eou__  Yes , please . My telephone number is 367 - 1314 . You can call me between four and six in the afternoon . __eou__
 Yes , please . My telephone number is 367 - 1314 . You can call me between four and six in the afternoon . __eou__  We'll get in touch with you by next Wednesday . Thank you for your interest in this job . __eou__
 Yes it is , but you ’ ll have to discuss the details with your manager . __eou__  Good . Now , if you ’ ll just sign here , you can start work in 3 days . __eou__
 I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue . __eou__  Sorry , could you tell me your name ? __eou__
 Sorry , could you tell me your name ? __eou__  I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova . __eou__
 Firstly , we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes . And then on the day when he is coming , we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate . __eou__  Well , that's right . How about on a formal occasion ? What should I say to show my gratitude ? __eou__
 It's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group . __eou__  And then , what should we do next when you meet the guests ? __eou__
 Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break , meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know . __eou__  That sounds good , Fred ! __eou__
 I suppose we can bring him to visit our company , as well as our display room . In this way , he can know more about our company and our potential power . In my opinion , visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much . __eou__  En , you are right , and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon . But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret . On one hand , show his our best side ; on the other hand , do not show too much to protect our own business secrets . __eou__
 En , you are right , and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon . But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret . On one hand , show his our best side ; on the other hand , do not show too much to protect our own business secrets . __eou__  Well , I understand . __eou__
 During my trip here , I learned a lot and I get to know our choice of choosing your company as our partner is definitely right . I can feel and sense the potential of your company . And at last I wish our further cooperation will be sound and successful . __eou__  That's our pleasure . Mr . Ross , your visit leaves gorgeous memory here . And I hope Mr.Halmiton , the president of your company can also have the chance to visit our company soon . Remember me to him , please . __eou__
 That's our pleasure . Mr . Ross , your visit leaves gorgeous memory here . And I hope Mr.Halmiton , the president of your company can also have the chance to visit our company soon . Remember me to him , please . __eou__  Of course , I will . __eou__
What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ? __eou__  Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here . It's been 5 days since I came to visit here . Time really flies . I feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . I will miss you while I am leaving . Let's keep in touch in any way . What's more , to the success of our face-to-face meeting , to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies , bottom up ! __eou__
 Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better . __eou__  Definitely ! Thank you ! __eou__
 So you must consider dearly before you go to work . __eou__  I will . __eou__
 Yes , I'd like to make a reservation for eight tonight . __eou__  What time would you like your table ? __eou__
 At 7:30 pm . And I would like to sit in the non-smoking area . __eou__  Would you like to sit in the hall or in the private room ? __eou__
 The private room , please . __eou__  Wait for a moment , please . Let me check whether the private room is available or not . No problem . __eou__
 It will be for business dinner . Reserve it under the name of Nova , the manager of Fashion Clothes Company . __eou__  OK . A reservation for eight at7 : 30 , Room 208 . Please don't be more than half hour late , or we will have to give it to other guests . __eou__
 Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period . __eou__  I am sorry , I am just too excited and forget it . Can I look it through ? __eou__
 I am sorry , I am just too excited and forget it . Can I look it through ? __eou__  Of course , here you are . And you can ask me any question . __eou__
 Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__  Well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period . __eou__
 Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . Can you give me some time to think it over ? __eou__  Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ? __eou__
 Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ? __eou__  Yes . Thank you very much . Mr . Yang . __eou__
Well , Betty . Since you ’ Ve done well during the probation period , we decided to employ you formally . And now we need to sign the formal agreement . __eou__  Thank you very much , Mr . Smith . I am very happy that I ’ ll be a member of your team . May I see the agreement first ? __eou__
 Thank you very much , Mr . Smith . I am very happy that I ’ ll be a member of your team . May I see the agreement first ? __eou__  Of course . If you have any questions , just bring them out . __eou__
 OK , thank you . Well , I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview . Can you give me some explanations ? __eou__  Well , it ’ s like this , during your first year , you will enjoy this salary level , a year later , we ’ ll increase your salary by 20 % . __eou__
 Can we add up this item to the agreement ? __eou__  Yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement . Do you have any other questions ? __eou__
 No , thank you . Shall we sign the agreement now ? __eou__  Yes , welcome to our company . I hope we can cooperate happily . __eou__
 Yes , sir . Shall I explain the details of the plan now ? __eou__  You go ! __eou__
 I can offer you 5 , 000 yuan per month . Raises are given after three months ' probation period according to your performance . Is this satisfactory ? __eou__  Yes , it is quite satisfactory . I accept it . __eou__
 Thank you . Then I think it's time for us to sign a letter of intent . __eou__  Okay . __eou__
The Smiths are arriving at our city tomorrow . Can you draw up a schedule for them ? If they want to make any changes , minor changes can then be made . __eou__  Is there anything special they would like to do ? __eou__
 They would also like to have a meeting with our designers . And this time , their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation , so you need to pay more attention . __eou__  I will set it up . __eou__
Madam , I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . I think there are something needs to modify . __eou__  Which terms ? __eou__
 First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America . __eou__  Good . I will add this to the contract . __eou__
 The second thing I would like to point out , that is packaging . It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . But I think the wooden cases are much safer . __eou__  Well , you are right . Is there anything else ? __eou__
 Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft . __eou__  Do you have some points to bring up ? __eou__
 I see . Why not use wooden cases ? __eou__  If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . __eou__
 Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers . __eou__  That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . __eou__
 Good morning . Would you like to tell me something about the computer ? I've never seen this brand before . What is your superior brand ? __eou__  This is our new brand . I can make sure our computer board is one of the best boards . __eou__
 Can you tell me the specialty of your computer board ? __eou__  With pleasure . It's easy to have a memory expansion on board capacity and fulfill your needs for a computer . Besides , there is more space for extra cards to expand later on . __eou__
 Can you give me a wholesale list ? __eou__  Yes . The price differs depending on how many you want . __eou__
 Is the price negotiable ? __eou__  Yes . It depends . If you have a large order , we will give you a discount . __eou__
May I see the manager of your office ? __eou__  I'm afraid he's having an important meeting now . Can I help you ? __eou__
 Thank you . I am Fred , coming from Future Clothes Company . I've brought some catalogues of our new series of the summer clothes . I wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them . __eou__  Of course , he would . Would you leave them with me ? __eou__
 Of course , he would . Would you leave them with me ? __eou__  We are suppliers of the summer clothes of various styles and colors . I think you will be interested in some of our new products . We always keep the pace of the clothes fashion , so as to catch the interest of our customers . __eou__
 Good . I'll send your catalogues to those who are interested . Meanwhile , may I have an indication of price ? Can I have your price-sheet ? __eou__  Yes , of course , here you are . The prices are subject to our confirmation . __eou__
 I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services . __eou__  How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ? __eou__
 Please look into the matter and solve the problem immediately . __eou__  We will check with the parties concerned right away . __eou__
 Can we get in touch with you by e-mail ? Is this convenient for you ? __eou__  It ’ s quite convenient . __eou__
 Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one . __eou__  Well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one . __eou__
 So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation . __eou__  To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent . __eou__
 To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent . __eou__  As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent . __eou__
 Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__  No , certainly not . __eou__
You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ? __eou__  We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . __eou__
 All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__  I am sorry to say that it's a little higher . Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission . __eou__
 You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__  Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . __eou__
Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? __eou__  Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter . __eou__
 Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ? __eou__  What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now . __eou__
 But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ? __eou__  It seems that I have nothing to do , except this . __eou__
Excuse me , I want to know the price of your CPU . __eou__  Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars . __eou__
 It's rather too high . If you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously . __eou__  If you order a large amount , we can give you a discount . __eou__
 Can you reduce more ? __eou__  I'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price . __eou__
 In that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . Please reconsider . __eou__  It is so hard to deal with . __eou__
 If you can give us a more reduction , We'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__  This price is the best we can make . __eou__
Nice to meet you , sir . I come from New Times Clothes Company . We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous . Would you please quote the price ? __eou__  Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ? __eou__
 Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor . __eou__  OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion . __eou__
I've come to hear about your offer . __eou__  We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days . __eou__
 I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected . __eou__  You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . __eou__
 I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies . __eou__  But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . __eou__
 To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . __eou__  Impossible . How about 5 % off ? __eou__
 Impossible . How about 5 % off ? __eou__  Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable . __eou__
Well , let's have your firm order . __eou__  Yes , here is our offer , 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt , FOB New York . You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market . __eou__
 Your price is rather high . We cannot accept it . Can you bring the price down a little ? __eou__  In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price . __eou__
 I can't agree with you . We have quotation from other sources too . Their prices are lower than yours . __eou__  But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . In fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year . __eou__
 I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ? __eou__  I'm afraid not . That is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way . __eou__
 They are working in another factory to provide maintenance right now . Let me call them and see whether they have solved the problem . Please wait a moment . __eou__  I've just contacted our technicians . They say they can go to your factory tomorrow afternoon . Can you tell me your factory's address , so they can find you easier ? __eou__
 To provide the As excellent after-sales service is our motto . Please wait for our maintenance staff in your factory tomorrow afternoon . They will be there on time . __eou__  Thank you again ! __eou__
Mrs . Lin . Please hold all of my calls for the next hour . __eou__  OK , but do you want to talk to your wife if she calls ? __eou__
 OK , but do you want to talk to your wife if she calls ? __eou__  Yes , I'll talk to her . __eou__
Tom . Please do not disturb me for the next hour . __eou__  Are you having a meeting ? __eou__
 Yes , and I don't want to be interrupted . __eou__  I understand . __eou__
 Now we should design our booth . Do you know the number for our booth , B ? __eou__  Let me see the notice . It is here . Our booth number is E108 . Good number . __eou__
 Lucky number . Find its location now . __eou__  We can also consult some from these volunteers . __eou__
 We can also consult some from these volunteers . __eou__  Here it is . Well , remember to have our cards on to tell every visitor where we come from . __eou__
 Here it is . Well , remember to have our cards on to tell every visitor where we come from . __eou__  Should we put our samples on this table ? __eou__
Good morning , sir ! Please know some about our latest products . __eou__  These are your products ? __eou__
 They are our products . Please come in and have a look . This is the catalogue for our products . __eou__  May I have your name card ? I am always concerned about the newest computer . __eou__
 May I have your name card ? I am always concerned about the newest computer . __eou__  Of course , here you are . __eou__
 Would you sit down and write down your name and address here ? __eou__  OK ! Would you like to recommend some for our reference ? __eou__
 OK ! Would you like to recommend some for our reference ? __eou__  This is the latest design for our products . The design of I-series keeps the fashion in a close way . The sales volume of the new product is about 50,000 per month . And we received many orders from many clothes companies . New functions and attractive outlook are the key points for our products . __eou__
 Yes , I need to talk to him . __eou__  I'll put the call through then . __eou__
 I'll put the call through then . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
Do you want to talk with John with tongue ? __eou__  No , tell him I'm tied up . __eou__
 Tell him to call me tomorrow morning . __eou__  All right . __eou__
 I need to talk with Marry . __eou__  Certainly , hold on . __eou__
 Oh well , do you know if the Susan Li is available ? __eou__  One moment and I'll check . __eou__
 Yes , but let me check if he's available . __eou__  Ok . __eou__
 I need to speak with David Lin . __eou__  He's out of his office . __eou__
 May I tell him who's calling ? __eou__  Yes , this is Tom White . __eou__
 Just a minute please , Mr . White . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 All right , could I leave a message ? __eou__  Certainly ! __eou__

 Sue , this is Tom Lin from Allied Trust and I'm calling to offer you a position with our firm . __eou__  What position ? __eou__
 Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__  It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field . __eou__
 Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ? __eou__  Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue . __eou__
 You are well-informed . Can you tell me something about the Patent Law in our country from the book you are reading ? __eou__  I just read this in the whole afternoon . Let me show you . __eou__
 I just read this in the whole afternoon . Let me show you . __eou__  So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem . __eou__
 So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem . __eou__  The purpose of the law is to protect and encourage inventions and to promote the development of science and technology . The law came into effect in 1984 , and it consists of 8 chapters with 69 articles . __eou__
Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ? __eou__  Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . __eou__
OK ! Let's get down to business now . __eou__  Say it . __eou__
 As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series . __eou__  That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task . __eou__
 I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign . __eou__  Could you put it in detail ? __eou__
 Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule . __eou__  I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent . __eou__
 I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent . __eou__  What kind of media do you recommend ? __eou__
 I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it . __eou__  Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers . __eou__
 Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers . __eou__  I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products . Meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company's image . __eou__
Let's get down to business . __eou__  OK . Have you seen the samples ? __eou__
 Yes . I have . I'm interested in your underwear . If the price is acceptable we would like to order it soon . __eou__  I'm glad to hear that . We are trying to give you a favourable one . __eou__
 I'm glad to hear that . We are trying to give you a favourable one . __eou__  What's your price ? __eou__
 All right . I go up to 115 yuan , but not a penny more . Is that acceptable ? __eou__  If you order more than 10,000 pieces , we can accept 115 yuan for each one . __eou__
 Well , I'll accept the price and place an order for 10,000 pieces . __eou__  Very good . It's a pleasure to do business with you , Mrs . Phoebe . __eou__
Mrs . Phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods . __eou__  Sure . What's your date of delivery ? __eou__
 Can you deliver them earlier ? __eou__  I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? __eou__
 I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? __eou__  Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . __eou__
 Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . __eou__  I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . __eou__
 I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . __eou__  I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . __eou__

 Can we make it 11:30 ? A customer will come to the office at 11 . __eou__  Oh , yes . That's fine with me . Maybe we can have lunch together . __eou__

 You're very kind to say so . Thank you . Do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ? __eou__  I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem . In fact , he's booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon . __eou__

 Not at all , sir . I'd just like to delay our meeting to next week , I'll have time at the beginning of next week . __eou__  Well , I don't like it , but I guess I don't have any choice . __eou__
 How about Monday morning at 9 a . m . ? __eou__  OK , I'll go to your office at that time . __eou__
 What's the problem ? We really can't have any delays at this stage . We're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget . __eou__  The cement arrived late but don't worry , I'm confident we can still meet the deadline . The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again . __eou__

The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it . Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area . Just to the right of Maintenance , there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section . Process Control is also on the upper level . It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below . __eou__
Could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please ? __eou__  Well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted . __eou__

Hi , Mary , you have been a secretary for several years in this company . Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference ? __eou__  Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting . __eou__

 Yes , you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer , and then send those materials to each business worker . __eou__  OK , I'll do it right now . __eou__
 By the way , to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip . __eou__  Yes , I get it . __eou__
Miss Gray , would you please type this report for me ? __eou__  Of course , Mr . Green . __eou__

There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . We'll have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime . __eou__  I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance . __eou__
 To start with I would like something part time with the hope that it can develop into something full time . __eou__  So you are interested in being with a company for the long term ? __eou__
 Here is an application . Please fill it out to the best of your ability . Did you bring a resume and references ? __eou__  Yes , I did . I have them here . __eou__
 Keep them until you ready to give me the application and you can turn them all in at once . __eou__  Thank you very much . This should only take me a few minutes . __eou__
 Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while . __eou__  OK , OK ! __eou__
 Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ? __eou__  Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising . __eou__
 Give me a break , Mr Yang . __eou__  Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ? __eou__
 Thank you . I'm from America . Here is my business card . __eou__  Glad to meet you , Mr . Smith . My name is Wang and here is my name card . I'll be glad to do what I can for you . __eou__
 Great ! This is my first visit to the Fair . Everything is new to me . Would you please give me some information ? __eou__  Glad to . The Fair is a big gathering taking place twice a year , thousands of businessmen from more than a hundred and fifty countries and regions are here to trade with China . __eou__
Good morning , sir , can I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I was wondering if you had the time to show me around this exhibition ? __eou__
 Yes , I was wondering if you had the time to show me around this exhibition ? __eou__  I'd be glad to , sir . But may I ask what line of business you are in ? __eou__
 I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company . __eou__  Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation . __eou__
 Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ? __eou__  Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets . __eou__
 I'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow . __eou__  That would be great . __eou__
 Can I have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data ? __eou__  Why , of course . Here are some that will show you our latest development . You may select which ever you need . __eou__
 If you give us your inquiry , I shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms . __eou__  OK , I'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list . __eou__
 OK , I'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list . __eou__  Yes , surely . We hope to do some substantial business with you . __eou__
 Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 . __eou__  Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful . __eou__
 Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age . __eou__  I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it . __eou__
You are going to work as my office secretary from next Monday . Right now I want to show you the rules of our company . __eou__  Thank you for your instruction . I really need to know the rules before I play the game , so I can know more about our company . __eou__
 Money is not the only standard to decide your career . In fact , there are more important things you can refer to when evaluating your career . If I were you , I would choose one I like to do . __eou__  Actually , I am afraid I will be stuck in the job forever , if I choose a bad one . __eou__
 Here's our inquiry list . You'll find the required items , specifications and quantities all there . __eou__  Thanks . I'll look into it and let you have our firm offers tomorrow . __eou__
 Thanks . I'll look into it and let you have our firm offers tomorrow . __eou__  I don't need to remind you that the market has become very competitive . __eou__
 Then would you please make your prices CIF including five percent ? __eou__  Certainly . We can work them out for you . __eou__
We have made some adjustment on the prices . And this is renewed price list . __eou__  Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . __eou__
 This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction . __eou__  If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . __eou__
 We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . __eou__  So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market . __eou__
 So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market . __eou__  How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? __eou__
 How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? __eou__  Agreed . __eou__
 I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . __eou__  I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . __eou__
 Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? __eou__  We've already cut down our price to cost level . __eou__
 Is that all ? __eou__  Yes , this is the best we can do . __eou__
 Well , we're really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want . __eou__  Great , I'm glad we'll be able to do business together . I'll have some quotations ready for you by tomorrow morning . __eou__
 Great , I'm glad we'll be able to do business together . I'll have some quotations ready for you by tomorrow morning . __eou__  Fine . As well , would you mind if I asked to see the Loyd's surveyor report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis . __eou__
 Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? __eou__  Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . __eou__
 There is no need to do like this . We can surf the net and find some templates for resume . __eou__  Sounds good . I will do it in a jiffy . OK ! Let's put our heads together . __eou__
 You said it . We can also find some helpful advice from some experts . __eou__  Terrific ! __eou__
 But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties . __eou__  YOU GET ME ! __eou__
 All the fears are nothing . You can make it . There is no other choice for you . Be brave . __eou__  Seemingly there is no turning back . I have to face it somehow . __eou__
Can you help me ? The program is not responding and I don't know what to do . __eou__  Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen . Is it flashing ? __eou__
 OK . Try closing down all the files you're not using at the moment . __eou__  But I can't move the cursor at all . My screen is frozen . What should I do ? __eou__
 OK , you ’ ll need to reboot your machine . Press Control , Alt and Delete at the same time . __eou__  I've never done that before . Will I lose all my files ? __eou__
 I've never done that before . Will I lose all my files ? __eou__  You might lose the file you were working on , but don't worry , the help desk can restore it . When did you last take a backup ? __eou__
Could you just run through the evacuation procedure ? __eou__  Yes , of course . When you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible . __eou__
 Yes , of course . When you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible . __eou__  Should we use the stairs ? __eou__
 Raise the alarm by breaking the glass of the nearest fire alarm . Call Security , say ' Fire ' and give your name and exact location . At night you should phone the fire service from the nearest telephone . __eou__  Should I try to put the fire out ? __eou__
It's so earlier this morning , Mr . Li ! You just came back yesterday , you should have rest much more . __eou__  I'd like to have rest , but I have many things to do . __eou__
 Of course . I will write a report about this post-trip , and then you'd better type it at the moment , OK ? __eou__  OK , it's no problem . __eou__
 ( Afternoon ) Miss Liu . Are you typing my report ? __eou__  Yes , what can I do for you ? __eou__
 Nothing . I just tell you take care of it when you type , especially the address and telephone number of those new guests . You should make sure that it's no mistaken . __eou__  OK , please don't worry about it . You should set your mind at rest . __eou__
 Yes , I did . Can you call after 7 p . m . ? I'm usually out in the daytime . __eou__  All right . Good-bye . __eou__
 Here's your schedule . After this meeting , we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager . And you'll be having dinner with our director . __eou__  Could you arrange a meeting with your boss ? __eou__
 Could you arrange a meeting with your boss ? __eou__  Of course . I've arranged it at 10 0 ' clock tomorrow morning . __eou__
 Well , shall we get down to business ' . __eou__  Sure , did you receive the sample we sent last week ? __eou__
 Yes , we finished the evaluation of it . If the price is acceptable we would like to order now . __eou__  I'm very glad to hear that . __eou__
 I think the price is a little high , can't you reduce it __eou__  I'm afraid we can't . $ 12.50 is our rock bottom price . If you purchase more than 10,000 units we can reduce it to $ 12.00 . __eou__
 Well , I'll accept the price and place an initial order of 10,000 units . __eou__  Very good . It's been a pleasure to do business with you , Mr . Smith . __eou__
 The pleasure is ours . Can you deliver the goods by March 31 ? __eou__  Of course . __eou__
 To secure employment hopefully with your company . __eou__  How long would you like to stay with this company ? __eou__
Could you arrange an appointment with Mr . Smith ? __eou__  Sorry , Mr . Smith agenda is full today . __eou__
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__  I ’ m not sure , but I will arrange for you and inform you as well . __eou__
We have some quality-control problems . Mr . Zhang . We need to go to the source to work them out . __eou__  What problems are you having exactly ? __eou__
 The least expensive , but still fully functional . And we think that your factory needs to take measures to improve quality-control . __eou__  That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike . __eou__
 That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike . __eou__  I am afraid that is not acceptable . Your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent . __eou__
 You can knock off another 2 % for that . __eou__  We can borrow as much as we can . __eou__
 Good morning . Could I speak to someone in the sales department , please ? __eou__  Hold on , please . __eou__
 Hold on , please . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Hello , Mr . lie . I would like to discuss with you the feasibilities of establishing a joint venture with your company . __eou__  That is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . May I have some idea of your suggestion ? __eou__

 OK . We will increase our order . __eou__  All right , as a token of friendship , we accept your counter-offer . __eou__

 Could you talk about it in detail ? __eou__  Ok . You need to know what they like or dislike , what religions they follow .

Sometimes , people in different countries , have varying outlooks for cultural , political , religious . __eou__
 We really appreciate your efforts . Before we go to the core of matter , can you give us some idea of them on which you would be willing to operate as our agent ? __eou__  No problem . __eou__
I want to see the man responsible for selling typewriters . __eou__  My name is Steven . I'm the Sales Manager of this company . __eou__
 Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly . __eou__  Oh , I'm sorry about that . __eou__
 Don't worry , we'll soon fix them . __eou__  Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again . __eou__
 Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again . __eou__  I'll certainly look into that . __eou__

Would you please explain for me what a business contract implies ? __eou__  A contract is an agreement which is binding on both parties mutually . A contract might be formal or informal , oral or written . An implemented contract is one which has been fully executed by both sides ; an executive contract is one which is going to be performed . They are enforceable by laws and any party who defaults the contract may be sued and forced to make compensation . __eou__
 You see . I made what I consider to be a reasonable offerbased upon the rise in production costs and the continued fall in the exchange rate of Australian Dollar to U . S . Dollar . __eou__  Let me say something about the falling Australian Dollar . We're both hurt by the rising U . S . Dollar . We will have to pay more Renminbi for U . S . Dollar to buy wool from you . __eou__
 I think the best way I can do is to reduce our price by 2 % and I should think we could conclude a deal at $ 98 . __eou__  All right . I accept this reduced offer at $ 98 per metric ton FOB stowed . The other terms and conditions shall remain the same as those in the previous agreement . Now will you draft the agreement or shall I ? __eou__
 Your legal department is very good at these things . We can trust them with the drafting of the agreement . __eou__  Ok . Then well bring it over to you tomorrow morning . You'll sign it first , so it will only need my signature . Is that agreeable to you ? __eou__
 Ok . Then well bring it over to you tomorrow morning . You'll sign it first , so it will only need my signature . Is that agreeable to you ? __eou__  Very agreeable , Mr . Smith . It will only take me a minute to sign it and send it back to you . __eou__
May I come in ? __eou__  Come in , please . __eou__

 Good , we'll take 500 suits . __eou__  OK , thanks for the order . __eou__
 Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible . __eou__  I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month . __eou__
 Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then . __eou__  By all means . __eou__
Mr . Li , I come to remind you of the meeting scheduled at 11 o'clock this morning . __eou__  Oh , that's right . And the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting . __eou__
 By the way , the meeting will be held in your office . __eou__  OK , thank you very much . __eou__
How do you do ? I need your help in selecting a foreign market to invest ! __eou__  Fine . I have your letter and I've made some notes . __eou__
 We have quite a lot of import and export information and can give you figures on population , consumption , production , and foreign exchange reserves . __eou__  Great . I want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries . __eou__
 Great . I want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries . __eou__  But you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions . You can get much information about environment of investment . __eou__
Could you tell me something about investment environment of your country ? __eou__  Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . __eou__
 Please tell me about work you have done , which qualifies you for this job . __eou__  I ’ Ve received some special training in typing , shorthand and operating a fax machine , etc .. I ’ m experienced in IBM-PC . I can operate familiarly a word-processor , a fax machine , a photo and other office equipment . __eou__
Could you tell me which kind of payment you'll choose ? __eou__  We're going to pay by check . __eou__
 Will you please have the check certified ? __eou__  If you think it is necessary . __eou__
 Send it by the fastest way . __eou__  Are you going to ship this by air ? That might cost a little more . __eou__
 Are you going to ship this by air ? That might cost a little more . __eou__  How much ? __eou__
 I'll check the costs and call you back . __eou__  OK . __eou__
We've been discussing the project for two hours . Let's take a break . __eou__  Sounds good . I want to go get some coffee . __eou__
Mr.Chen , do you mind if I smoke ? __eou__  I'm sorry , Mrs . Lin . We don't allow smoking in the office . __eou__
 So , sit back and relax and get your order forms ready . __eou__  Because you're going to love this show ! __eou__
 All right . The area of the factory buildings is around 8,000 square meters . You can read the details in the invitations which will be sent tomorrow . __eou__  Thank you for your information . __eou__
Will you send the letter to the chairman of the committee ? __eou__  I should be most delighted . __eou__
This is our Submission of Tender which includes the information about volume of the project , the cost and so on . __eou__  OK ! We'll see it . __eou__
 Yes , you are supposed to pay it on time . If you don't furnish a tender bond on time , your tender will not be considered . Besides , you also should provide derailed engineering of the good . __eou__  Where do we submit the tender ? __eou__
 Yes , so far as we know , in the field , your company has lots of experience and we hope you will consider the tender seriously . __eou__  OK ! We will . Bye ! __eou__
 That's too bad . We could really use someone who is bilingual . __eou__  If you hire me , I'll start studying Spanish again . __eou__
 The best we can do is $ 120 per case . __eou__  I'm afraid that's impossible . You can't expect us to reduce it to that extent . __eou__
 I think you are well informed about the prevailing market.Some Spanish firms are offering the same at much lower prices . __eou__  Price can't be separated from quality . A comparison of the quality of our products with that of rival goods will show you that ours is far superior . __eou__
 It's true yours are of better quality . But your price is still on the high side even if we take quality into consideration . How about meeting each other half way ? __eou__  Well , I'll have to think about it and get back to you in about 30 minutes . __eou__
 Well , I'll have to think about it and get back to you in about 30 minutes . __eou__  Take your time , please . __eou__
 Could you tell me something about your English education ? __eou__  My mother is an English teacher in a college , so I began learning English when I could speak , and I took English as my minor subject at university . __eou__
Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ? __eou__  Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness . __eou__
 Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness . __eou__  That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need . __eou__
 And please let white color dominate . __eou__  OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ? __eou__
 Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city . __eou__  I'll tell them . __eou__
 Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . __eou__  Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery . __eou__
 We could take a cut on the price . But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . We suggest a compromise 10 % . __eou__  That's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . Any other ideas ? __eou__
 I don't think I can change it right now . Why don't we talk again tomorrow ? __eou__  Sure . I have to talk to my office anyway . I hope we can find some common ground on this . __eou__
 Robert , I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else . __eou__  I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground . __eou__
 I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % . __eou__  Dana . I can't bring those numbers back to my office , they'll turn it down flat . __eou__
Why not come over to work in my company ? __eou__  I need to think it over . __eou__
 Tell me what you need . __eou__  All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable . __eou__
Would you like me to fill out the form ? __eou__  I suppose so , but don't rush . I've got to tell you how to do it . __eou__
 I suppose so , but don't rush . I've got to tell you how to do it . __eou__  That's very kind of you . __eou__
 Surely it's a sound idea , Mr . Joey . But I have a few questions for you first . __eou__  I am all ears . __eou__
 First , can I know something about your financial situations ? __eou__  Sure . As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents . __eou__
 Sure . As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents . __eou__  Thank you . And how is your business in the clothing business circle ? __eou__
 I'd like to hear that . __eou__  For the substantial regular customers , we offer 5 % commissions . __eou__
 For the substantial regular customers , we offer 5 % commissions . __eou__  That sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ? __eou__
 That sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ? __eou__  Fabulous . I will get the contract ready shortly . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ? __eou__  Sure , please hold on . __eou__
 Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please . __eou__  You are so kind , you helped me a lot . __eou__
 By the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . __eou__  Really ? What is it ? __eou__
Today , we have invited a special guest , Prof . Yang . He will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . Your international legal advice is important to our business well being . Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises . __eou__  The significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . Despite many countries accession to TO membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . However , these frictions will be better managed under the TO trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism . __eou__
 I don't think we will be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . __eou__  I'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . __eou__
 Don't you agree with me that in the long run moderate prices we bring about large sales and more profit ? __eou__  We've already cut down our price to cost level . __eou__
 Is that all ? __eou__  Yes this is the best we can do . __eou__
Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . __eou__  That's OK . __eou__
 Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . __eou__  That's a good idea . __eou__
 First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . __eou__  Agreed . __eou__
 For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . __eou__  I understand your position . __eou__
 If possible , I'd like to be positioned in the International Trade Department . __eou__  Then , what starting salary do you expect ? __eou__
Mr . Anderson , the boss wants to see you . __eou__  I'm on my way . __eou__
How about 15 % the first six months and the second six months at 12 % with a guarantee of 3000 units ? __eou__  That's a lot to sell with very low profit margins . __eou__
 It's about the best we can do , Smith . We need to hammer something out today . If I go back empty-handed , I may be coming back to you soon to ask for a job . __eou__  OK . 17 % the first six months , 14 % for the second . __eou__
 OK . 17 % the first six months , 14 % for the second . __eou__  Good . Let's iron out the remaining details . When do you want to take delivery ? __eou__
 We'd like you to execute the first order by the 31 st . __eou__  Let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st . __eou__
 Fine . But I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1000 units , the next 2000 . The 31 st is quite soon , I can't guarantee 1500 . __eou__  I can agree to that . Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . __eou__
 It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg . __eou__  Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it . __eou__
 I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price . __eou__  We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market . __eou__
 We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market . __eou__  That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price . __eou__
 That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price . __eou__  But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value . __eou__
 Let me have a look . __eou__  OK . __eou__
Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . __eou__  All right . In my first teaching position I received the ' Excellent Teaching ' award the past two years in succession . __eou__
 Could you tell me the particulars ? __eou__  I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ? __eou__
Professor wang can I ask a few questions ? __eou__  Certainly . __eou__
Could you copy this document for me ? __eou__  It's my pleasure . How many copies would you want ? __eou__
 A hundred and fifty . No , wait , make that a hundred and sixty . __eou__  Yes , sir . Will there be anything else ? __eou__
Miss Liu , please come in . __eou__  What can I do for you , sir ? __eou__
 Copy this report for me . __eou__  OK . But which size should I use ? __eou__
 You should use the A4 paper is all right . __eou__  I see . Should I have it bound ? __eou__
 It is unnecessary . __eou__  That is all right . __eou__
Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ? __eou__  Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization . __eou__
 No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company . __eou__  Of course , let me find one for you . __eou__
Mr . Smith , while you're out , the sales department called and asked you to lunch next Wednesday . __eou__  I'll put them in my schedule . Are there any other messages ? __eou__
 Oh , yes , Miss Chen informed that the monthly management meeting has been changed to July 11 and I've marked your diary accordingly . __eou__  Thanks a lot . __eou__
 Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? __eou__  Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . __eou__
 That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . __eou__  That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . __eou__
 That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . __eou__  I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ? __eou__
 I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ? __eou__  Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ? __eou__
 Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ? __eou__  All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set . __eou__
 Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . __eou__  I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . __eou__
 I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . __eou__  What's your proposal then ? __eou__
 I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . __eou__  We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? __eou__
 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . __eou__  That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . __eou__
 What's your counter-offer then ? __eou__  To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . __eou__
 To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . __eou__  15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . __eou__
 How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . __eou__  8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . __eou__
 Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further . __eou__  Ok . Let's call it a deal . __eou__
We have made some adjustment on the prices , and this is renewed price list . __eou__  Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . __eou__
 This is our rock-bottom price and we can't make any further reduction . __eou__  If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . __eou__
 We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . __eou__  So are we , our counter-offer is in line with the world market . __eou__
 So are we , our counter-offer is in line with the world market . __eou__  How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? __eou__
 How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? __eou__  Agreed . __eou__
 Some of them are of the latest style . Now I have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish business relationship with you . __eou__  Your desire coincides with ours . __eou__
 Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to our bank.or to our local chamber of commerce or inquiry agencies . __eou__  Thank you for your information . As you know , our corporation is a state-operated one . We always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit . I have no doubt that it will bring about benefit between us . __eou__
 That sounds interesting ! I'll send a fax . As soon as I receive the definite answer , I'll give you a special answer . __eou__  We will make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be put through between us . __eou__
 We will make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be put through between us . __eou__  So do I . __eou__
 I hope everything will be smooth . __eou__  That is what I want to say . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Jones . We need to have a meeting to discuss our deal . __eou__  Shall I come to your office this afternoon ? __eou__
 Shall I come to your office this afternoon ? __eou__  That would be great ! How about 2:30 ? __eou__
 Ms . Yang , can you tell us in what ways the new EBB is better than the old model ? __eou__  Certainly . First of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . So on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and ... __eou__
 Oh , how do you to Mr . White ? My name is Li Ming , here is my card . __eou__  Nice to meet you Mr.Li . We have learned about that you specialize in the export business of electronic products . As you enjoy the highest reputation in the commercial circle , we'd be please to enter into business relations with your firm . __eou__
 Nice to meet you Mr.Li . We have learned about that you specialize in the export business of electronic products . As you enjoy the highest reputation in the commercial circle , we'd be please to enter into business relations with your firm . __eou__  We share the same desire . Have you seen the display of our products in the exhibition hall downstairs ? __eou__
 Thank you for your information , we can hold more talks later on business details . __eou__  Sure . __eou__
Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting . __eou__  Cancelled ? That's just can't happen ! __eou__
 Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday . __eou__  Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday . __eou__
 Thank you . I'd like Chinese tea very much ! __eou__  Glad you like it . By the way , is this your first time to China , Mr . White ? __eou__
 Yes , as a representative of IBM . I hope to conclude some business with you . __eou__  We also hope to expand our business with you . __eou__
 Yes , I have read about it , but I would like to know more about it . __eou__  Right . Seeing is believing . __eou__
 Oh , I am sorry . I misunderstood . Well , in that case , the contract can be canceled with a 2 month's notice . What do you say ? __eou__  That sounds perfect for us . __eou__
 You'll have a definite answer from us within a week . Goodbye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
Please sit down . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 I think this type of position would be a very good start for you . I am quite sure we can work something out for you , but I cannot give you a definite answer today . We will let you know within just a few days . __eou__  Fine . Thank you very much . __eou__
 I am new to the work and I will appreciate your guidance ! __eou__  I will try my best to assist you if you need any help . __eou__
Hi , I'm calling about the ad in the paper . __eou__  Which ad would that be ? __eou__
 Yes , it is . But we'll be making a decision on it pretty soon . Why don't you come in and fill out an application ? __eou__  What company is this for ? I mean where's the opening ? __eou__
 We can discuss that when you come in and fill out the application . __eou__  Well , I'm already in this field and know most of the companies . Before I come in to fill out an application , I need to know who it's with so I know whether or not I'm willing to work with them . __eou__
 Well , I'm already in this field and know most of the companies . Before I come in to fill out an application , I need to know who it's with so I know whether or not I'm willing to work with them . __eou__  I'm afraid I can't discuss that over the phone . __eou__
 I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet . __eou__  On the Internet ? I've never heard of it . __eou__
 It's very convenient and it has become popular recently . __eou__  Is that safe ? __eou__
 Of course , if you log on some standard websites . __eou__  Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try . __eou__
Paul , a company called me for an interview . __eou__  That's great ! You need to prepare for it . __eou__
 That's great ! You need to prepare for it . __eou__  How ? __eou__
 Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview . __eou__  OK . __eou__
 Buy a decent suit . __eou__  Is a white blouse OK ? __eou__
 Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . __eou__  How about make up ? __eou__
I called about that ad we saw in the paper . __eou__  For the construction site manager ? __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in English . __eou__
 Yes , I'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in English . __eou__  I'm Mary Kelly . May I ask your name ? __eou__
 I'm Mary Kelly . May I ask your name ? __eou__  My name is B . How are you , Miss Kelly ? __eou__
 I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . __eou__  Thank you , Miss Kelly . __eou__
 Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ? __eou__  Yes , I would . __eou__
 ( After testing ) Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? __eou__  Yes , I'd like to give it a try . __eou__
 Can I give her a message for you ? __eou__  Yes , please tell her I stopped by . __eou__
 Yes , please tell her I stopped by . __eou__  And your name , please ? __eou__
 Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ? __eou__  Certainly . __eou__
Do you have a free moment ? __eou__  Sure . What do you need ? __eou__
 Sure . What do you need ? __eou__  I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? __eou__
 Well , first you have to turn this switch on . __eou__  Silly me . __eou__
 Now press this button . __eou__  Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? __eou__
 Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? __eou__  Just a second . I'll go get some . __eou__
 Kate , I know you ’ Ve been a stewardess for more than one year . And I ’ ll have an interview on stewardess tomorrow . Can you tell me some etiquette about the interview ? __eou__  Of course . First you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick . __eou__
 Of course . First you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick . __eou__  Is there anything else I should pay attention to ? __eou__
 Yes , when you attend the interview , you should pay attention to your manner , style of conversation and expression . You should keep smiling always , being polite when you talk with the interviewer . Don't move from time to time when you sit there . And you also should know how to use eye contact . __eou__  Thank you , I've learned so much from you . __eou__
Come in , please . __eou__  Good morning , sir ! __eou__
 Good morning , please make yourself comfortable . __eou__  Thank you , sir . __eou__
 Pardon ? __eou__  Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao . __eou__
 Can you leave me your phone number ? __eou__  Gladly , 8962105 2 . __eou__
I'd like to start by talking about prices . __eou__  I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have . __eou__
 Your products are very good , but the price you ask is much too high . __eou__  If you consider our high research costs and excellent quality , the price we are asking is only reasonable . __eou__
 You're right . I think it ’ s time to seek professional help . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 I know you don ’ t want to pay for a job , but I think it ’ s time we consulted a headhunter . __eou__  You ’ re right , I don ’ t want to pay , but I don ’ t want to live without pay , either . __eou__
 Cooke & Co . does a lot of placements in your field . __eou__  Ya , they do . Anyone else come to mind ? __eou__
 Ya , they do . Anyone else come to mind ? __eou__  Not at the moment , but I ’ ll let you know . __eou__
 I've enjoyed the conversation with you . We'll call you within 5 working days . __eou__  Thank you . I appreciate the time you've given to me . __eou__
 Yes , . Do you mind I have a look at your computer ? __eou__  Of course not , I appreciate that . __eou__
 Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__  I see . What can I do now ? __eou__
 Can you start on Monday ? __eou__  I'm afraid not , but can you make it Thursday afternoon ? __eou__
 I'm afraid not , but can you make it Thursday afternoon ? __eou__  That's all right . When you come , ask for Smith , OK ? __eou__
 That's all right . When you come , ask for Smith , OK ? __eou__  Yes . See you then . __eou__
 It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . __eou__  You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . __eou__
 Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . __eou__  Good idea . __eou__
Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? __eou__  Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? __eou__
 Experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ? __eou__  Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ? __eou__
 Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go . __eou__  Good idea . __eou__
Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? __eou__  Let me check . It has a paper jam . __eou__
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . __eou__  Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . __eou__
 Maybe . But you should not withdraw forever just because you failed once . __eou__  OK , thank you , I'll try if there were other chances . __eou__
 It is tough to accept it , I mean . But can you tell me why ? __eou__  It is hard to tell . Maybe it is because you're not resourceful enough to be a manager . __eou__
I am calling to tell you that you are hired by our company . __eou__  I really appreciate your offer , but I have to decline it , because I have already taken another job which I prefer to work in . __eou__
 You are welcome , Please call me if you change your mind . __eou__  I will . Thank you . __eou__
 I'd like to tell you that you could come to work with us . __eou__  Oh , I'm sorry , but I've just accepted another offer that I feel is more suitable to my needs . __eou__
 Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? __eou__  No problem , here you are . __eou__
We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things . __eou__  Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . __eou__
 Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . __eou__  Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__
 Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__  Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . __eou__
 Can you name a few examples ? __eou__  Yes . There are selected itineraries for rich and high-tasted people , common routine for people who are on trade observation tour , and excursion routine for people who have limited time for sightseeing . __eou__
 I'm Lui , I'd like to Speak to Mr . Smiths . __eou__  Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and Jim Smith , which one would you like to speak to ? __eou__
 I'd like to speak to Mr Robert Smith . __eou__  He is on the line . __eou__
 You should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . At least you should get yourself dressed up . Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you . __eou__  Anything else ? __eou__
 Don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest . __eou__  What do you mean by this ? You can ’ t do the two things at the same time . __eou__
 Appear confident and show the interviewers that you ’ re competent . Don ’ t exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you ’ re talking big . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 Try to be natural , alert and interested . __eou__  You ’ Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now . Thank you very much . __eou__
Hi , Yang Tang . Come in ! Pretty hot out there , isn't it ? Did you have trouble finding us ? Sit ! Sit ! __eou__  Hello , Mr . Jones , its ... __eou__
 Yang Tang , just call me Fred ! Everyone does . __eou__  Ei , OK , er .. Fred . Thank you for seeing me today . __eou__
 Please take a seat . __eou__  Thank you , madam . __eou__
 We have received your letter and resume , and we thought we would like to ask you to come here for an interview . __eou__  It is a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity for interview . __eou__
 Have you brought your credentials ? __eou__  Yes , here they are . This is my ID card . This is my diploma . And this is my certificate for nurse qualifications . __eou__
 Of course . The manner of shaking hands can show a man ’ s character . For example , the interviewer who shakes your hand lightly , is a easygoing man although he looks cool . __eou__  Anything else ? __eou__
May I come in ? __eou__  Yes , please . I ’ m Mr . Peter , the Director of Personnel . What can I do for you ? __eou__
 Nice to meet you , Mr . Peter . I ’ m Wang Sian . I ’ Ve come for an interview as requested . __eou__  Oh , yes . How do you do , Miss Wang ? Sit down , please . __eou__
 Oh , yes . How do you do , Miss Wang ? Sit down , please . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__  Ok . __eou__
Hi , Alan . I feel very nervous because I am going to have a job interview next Monday . Could you please give me some suggestions ? __eou__  Sure . Firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . Interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic . __eou__
 Sure . Firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . Interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic . __eou__  Yeah , that is very important . __eou__
 Secondly , you need to create a good image in a limited time . __eou__  I will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done . __eou__
 I think you should make some preparations . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . What ’ s more , try to avoid a too causal style . __eou__  Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview ? __eou__
 Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview ? __eou__  You ’ d better not . Informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__
 That's great ! You need to prepare for it . __eou__  How ? __eou__
 Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview . __eou__  Okay . __eou__
 Buy an expensive suit . __eou__  How expensive ? __eou__
 The more expensive , the better . __eou__  I can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ? __eou__
 I can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ? __eou__  That'll do it . The best way is to find the dressing color code of the company . __eou__
 If you know somebody at the company , ask them . If not , dark color will be fine . __eou__  Is a white blouse okay ? __eou__
 Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . __eou__  Black ? __eou__
 Black is good . __eou__  White pantyhose ? __eou__
 No . Dark or skin colored . __eou__  Jewelry ? __eou__
 Necklace , ring , and earrings are all fine . But don ’ t wear too many pieces of jewelry . __eou__  How about make up ? __eou__
 Not much make up . __eou__  Perfume ? __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I ’ Ve come in apply for the position as head of claim department . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ Ve come in apply for the position as head of claim department . __eou__  I ’ m Smith , the manager of Human Resources Department . May I ask your name ? __eou__
 Would you tell me what education background you have ? __eou__  I graduated from Beijing College of Foreign Trade . My major was International Trade . __eou__
 OK . I will accept you for a three months-period of probation . Is this satisfactory ? __eou__  Yes . __eou__
Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__  Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . __eou__
 Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . __eou__  Yeah , that's very important . __eou__
 So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . __eou__  I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__
 That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . __eou__  It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . __eou__
 It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . __eou__  But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . __eou__
 I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__  It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . __eou__
 You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . __eou__  I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . __eou__
 You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . __eou__  It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . __eou__
 Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . __eou__  But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . __eou__
 You are so careless . You know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . Do remember not to smoke any more , otherwise , you can ’ t find a job . __eou__  Yes , I know . And next time I must make good preparations . __eou__
 Yes , I am . I'm very interested in that advertisement about hiring a computer program designer , and hope to know a little more about it . __eou__  What kind of information would you like ? __eou__
 Terrific ! Then how should I apply for ? __eou__  Oh , we need your resume , health report , three photographs and several letters of recommendation . Would you please send them to us by next Wednesday ? __eou__
 Oh , we need your resume , health report , three photographs and several letters of recommendation . Would you please send them to us by next Wednesday ? __eou__  Thank you very much . Bye-bye . __eou__
 Not at all . Please sit down , then we can begin . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
Come in , young man . __eou__  ( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei , nice to meet you , sir . __eou__
 I am Smith , the personnel director . Please have a seat , son . __eou__  Thank you . Have you received my resume ? __eou__
 Actually , I haven ’ t had time to look it over . Did you bring another copy with you ? __eou__  Of course , here you are , sir . __eou__
 Of course , here you are , sir . __eou__  Call me Mr . Smith . __eou__
 Call me Mr . Smith . __eou__  Certainly , Mr . Smith . __eou__
 Give me your telephone number , please . __eou__  ( My telephone number is ) 139xxxxx345 . __eou__
 That ’ s true , but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn ’ t have . __eou__  Not enough to worry about . Why do I waste the money buying two papers ? __eou__
 It's only a couple of dollars more . For that much money you can afford to risk it . __eou__  I guess you ’ re right . I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe . __eou__
 Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ? __eou__  Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ? __eou__
 Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ? __eou__  What ’ s this form for ? __eou__
 This is for registration . After you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you . __eou__  That's great . But how long do I have to wait ? __eou__
 My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . If you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too . __eou__  I see . Thank you very much for your advice . Bye . __eou__
 Yeah . If you are available now , let me describe your work duties , OK ? __eou__  What am I expected to do ? __eou__
 As a newcomer , you are going to be responsible for some basic tasks first , including certain routine duties like answering the telephone and typing . Later , you will be assigned to the Sales Department . __eou__  I see . It must be a challenging job , but I would like to do it . And what about now ? __eou__
 For this is your first day in our company , you can begin with our special products . Before you do your job , it's necessary for you to be familiar with our own products . Sort these papers and file them correctly . __eou__  OK , I'll get to work on it at once . __eou__
Good morning , sir . Have a seat please . __eou__  I would like to know the state of the residential property market right now because I have an apartment to sell . __eou__
 I would like to know the state of the residential property market right now because I have an apartment to sell . __eou__  Sure , here is my business card . I'm James Wilson . Let me explain to you how things are . In recent months , the demand for residential properties has become extremely high . The price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent . __eou__
 Sure , here is my business card . I'm James Wilson . Let me explain to you how things are . In recent months , the demand for residential properties has become extremely high . The price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent . __eou__  Really ? Since I have to go back to England within the next few months , I would like to sell my apartment as soon as possible . __eou__
 Really ? Since I have to go back to England within the next few months , I would like to sell my apartment as soon as possible . __eou__  Don't worry , sir . I think it's a seller's market right now . Let me get down some information about your apartment first . what is your property's address ? __eou__
 I would like to ask for four point five million Hong Kong dollars . __eou__  May I have your name and contact number , Sir ? __eou__
 May I have your name and contact number , Sir ? __eou__  Johnson , and my contact number is 2876543 2 . My office number is 2123456 7 . __eou__
 Also , Mr . Johnson , I would like to remind you my company will charge a commission equivalent to one percent of the transaction price in the event of a successful selling of the property through our introduction . __eou__  No problem . __eou__
 Thank you very much . I will introduce your property to our clients . When they want to see your property , I will give you a call . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too tight . __eou__  I'm not sure . I can't agree , dan . __eou__
 Surely , there are other ways to save money . __eou__  What are you talking about , we've tried everything ! __eou__
 I was hoping to talk to you today about your business . __eou__  Very well . __eou__
 How about a cup of coffee ? __eou__  I will make it now . __eou__
 And can you tell me what meetings I have this week ? __eou__  I will bring the diary . __eou__
 I will bring the diary . __eou__  Okay , this afternoon you have a meeting with your accountant at 5 pm . __eou__
 Okay , this afternoon you have a meeting with your accountant at 5 pm . __eou__  On Wednesday , you are going to London . Don't forget your train leaves at 9.30 am . __eou__
 On Wednesday , you are going to London . Don't forget your train leaves at 9.30 am . __eou__  Okay , what time is my meeting in London ? __eou__
 Well , I am thinking about redesigning my kitchen . __eou__  Do you prefer some specific style ? __eou__
 Fine , we will take an actual look at your kitchen before start working on it . __eou__  No problem . How about 10 ' o clock this Sunday morning ? __eou__
 No problem . How about 10 ' o clock this Sunday morning ? __eou__  Okay . Would you please leave your address and phone number ? __eou__
 Okay . Would you please leave your address and phone number ? __eou__  Of course . This is my card . See you then . __eou__
Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ? __eou__  Just fill out an application . __eou__
 Just fill out an application . __eou__  Do I have to send an E-mail ? __eou__
 You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit . __eou__  But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff . __eou__
 Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website . __eou__  Can any unit see my information ? __eou__
 I've had good responses from the Beijing Times , help-wanted ads . __eou__  All right . I suggest posting the ad Monday through Friday . __eou__
 All right . I suggest posting the ad Monday through Friday . __eou__  OK . Monday is the big day for job ads . __eou__
 And job seekers will certainly check the paper over on Tuesday . __eou__  Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites . __eou__
 Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites . __eou__  Such concern for the company , Craig ! I'm impressed . __eou__
 Don't be proud . You'll gain a lot in the following job . __eou__  Yeah , I believe it , but I want to know if you will give me a raise . __eou__
 Yeah , I believe it , but I want to know if you will give me a raise . __eou__  B , talking about salary is not smart . You are a new manager and you'd better learn more professional skills . __eou__
 You are right , boss , but I need specific confirm to keep the future work better . __eou__  Okay , You are such a good talker . __eou__
 Maybe you need a vacation or something , or maybe a bonus . __eou__  I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right . __eou__
 Why don't you talk to your boss about it ? If you talk to him , he will surely understand . __eou__  I wish he could understand . You know what , if this goes on , I think I will get stick like everybody else . __eou__
Would you mail a letter for me ? My hands are full . __eou__  Oh , I am sorry . I ’ m afraid I can ’ t do it now . I have to meet my supervisor in a few seconds . But I could mail it after that . __eou__
 That ’ s fine . We ’ re going to drop in and see Jimmy tonight . Don ’ t forget it . __eou__  I won ’ t . __eou__
 First day is often exciting , isn't it ? Here , let me show you to your desk . You can have this computer and telephone and share the copy machine with us in the office . How do you like it ? __eou__  This is wonderful . Thank you for doing all this for me , Miss Lee . __eou__
Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? __eou__  Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . __eou__
 Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? __eou__  All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . __eou__
Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . __eou__  All right . In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession . __eou__
As an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ? __eou__  Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . __eou__
 And we should have good sitting posture . __eou__  That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer . __eou__
 Put it beside you . Don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . You've got long hair . Don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work . __eou__  I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular . __eou__
 Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . __eou__  I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do . __eou__
 I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do . __eou__  As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__
 You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . __eou__  I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . __eou__
 Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . __eou__  I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . __eou__
 You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . __eou__  Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . __eou__
 In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . __eou__  Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ? __eou__
 Yes . Don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . If you do you ’ ll have bad breath . __eou__  I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . __eou__
 I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . __eou__  You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . __eou__
 You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . __eou__  I remember now . Your advice is very helpful . __eou__
 One more thing , if you are wanted in this position , you must prepare to travel aboard frequently . __eou__  That's fine with me . __eou__
 Would you mind relocating ? __eou__  As long as it isn't too far from this city , I don't mind . __eou__
 Then you'll need to know it's a hard job . You'll often have to work overtime or even on weekends . __eou__  Yes , but I don't mind working hard . __eou__
 Just remember to be professional and polite . Oh , and don ’ t forget to smile . __eou__  I ’ ll do my best , but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations . __eou__
 Have you updated your resume recently ? __eou__  Yes ... ah ! I forgot to include my e-mail address . __eou__
 You ’ d better double-and-triple check it . You don ’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume . Otherwise , you might shoot yourself in the foot . __eou__  I ’ ll be sure and do that . I also need to pick out the right suit , shirt , and tie for this interview . __eou__
 I ’ m included on your list of references , right ? My praise of you could really make a difference . __eou__  Sorry , you ’ re not on it . I don ’ t think using my brother as a reference would be very convincing ! __eou__
Name and examination number , please . __eou__  My name is Han Ran , number is 050920 . __eou__
 Well , then , please tell me about your English education . __eou__  I have been studying English since junior high school . And I majored in English in college . __eou__
 Oh , It's really far from here . May I ask how old you are ? __eou__  Yes , I ’ m 38 years old . __eou__
 We'll notify you next Thursday at the latest . Shall I telephone you ? __eou__  OK . __eou__
 Can I ask for a leave ? __eou__  Of course , if necessary . __eou__
Please come in and sit down . I ’ m happy to finally meet you . __eou__  Same here , Ms . Drake . I've been looking forward to this . __eou__
 Thank you . Can I get you some coffee or a cup of tea ? __eou__  I ’ m fine , thank you . __eou__
 Good , then let ’ s get to the interview . __eou__  Great , that ’ s why I ’ m here . __eou__
 You may ask questions about us , if you have any . __eou__  All right . When can I start ? __eou__
Would you like to travel ? __eou__  Oh , yes . I often went on business trips in the past six years . __eou__
 We'll start you off with a base salary of $ 20,000 a year , with bonuses that can add up to $ 40,000 . A company car , and a company pension scheme . Is that acceptable to you ? __eou__  I think so . __eou__
 Excellent . Well , thank you very much , Mr . B , and you'll be hearing from us in the next few days , either way . __eou__  Thank you . Mr . A , and I certainly hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . __eou__
 Today's interview is for us to get to know a little about you . If needed , there will be a more lengthy interview later . So , if you ’ re comfortable , let's begin . __eou__  OK . __eou__
 I'd like to start at 3000 yuan a month . __eou__  I think your background and experience are worth the compensation . __eou__
Come in , young man . __eou__  ( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei , nice to meet you , sir . __eou__
 Actually , I haven ’ t had time to look it over . Did you bring another copy with you ? __eou__  Of course , here you are , sir . __eou__
 Call me Mr . Smith . __eou__  Certainly , it would be my pleasure , Mr . Smith . __eou__
Please come in and sit down . I'm happy to finally meet you . __eou__  Same here . I've been looking forward to this . __eou__
 Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ? __eou__  Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice . __eou__
 May I ask the date of your birth ? __eou__  My birthday is June 14th , 1985 . __eou__
 Good answer , B - good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ? __eou__  Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . __eou__
 You shouldn ’ t work so hard . __eou__  I know . But hard work pays off , you know . __eou__
 Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! Just ask me if you need any help . __eou__  Thank you . It's very kind of you . __eou__
Mr . Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening . Here's an invitation for you . __eou__  How nice of him . I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ? __eou__
 If you could be ready by , say 6:30 o'clock , I'll be at the hotel to pick you up . __eou__  That's great . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Rose . __eou__
 I have to go now . I don't want to be late . __eou__  Don't worry , time is enough . __eou__
Hello , John , please invite all our clients to the conference next week . __eou__  How should I get their contact info . __eou__
 Get the clients ' contact info from my Rolodex . __eou__  Where should I put them up ? __eou__
 The clients like the Shangri-La Hotel more . __eou__  Well , the client is always right . __eou__
 Please print out the meeting agenda for me to look over . __eou__  Certainly . __eou__
 And make sure to return my Rolodex to my desk when you are done with it . __eou__  Of course . I'm on it __eou__
Susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in China ? __eou__  Well , as per capital income goes up and up , the growth sector seems to be in the high-end . __eou__
 Yes , Mr . Miller . We'll use the conference room on the third floor for the meeting . __eou__  That's right . The meeting is very important . Where shall the guests be received before the meeting begins ? __eou__
 We'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting . __eou__  I've arranged for an interpreter to be present . But it is said these foreigners could speak English . __eou__
 Well , after my report , there will be an interval for rest and refreshments . __eou__  All right , I see . __eou__
 Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? __eou__  Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here . __eou__
 We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? __eou__  That sounds good . __eou__
 4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough . __eou__  Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . __eou__
 Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . __eou__  You mean to saya __eou__
 All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately . __eou__  Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you . __eou__
 To show our appreciation for your hard work , we'd like to invite you to have dinner with us . __eou__  Oh , that would be lovely . Thank you . __eou__
 Excellent . Have you had French food before ? __eou__  Oh , yes . Marvelous ! __eou__

 Your LC must be opened at least onemonth before the time shipment , otherwise we won't be able to catch the ship . __eou__  No problem . I ’ ll have the covering LC opened as soon as I wetback . In addition , would you tell me by whom the commodity inspection is conducted before shipment ? __eou__
 Please remember to use both English and Chinese versions and both versions should be equally valid . __eou__  Naturally . Each of us keeps one original and two copies . __eou__
Can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is ? __eou__  Of course , here is the catalogue and the price list . You can have a look . We also have many other kinds of carpets . __eou__
 Of course , here is the catalogue and the price list . You can have a look . We also have many other kinds of carpets . __eou__  The price seems acceptable for me . But I want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some ? __eou__
 The price seems acceptable for me . But I want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some ? __eou__  Of course we can . We can provide the quantity you ask for . __eou__
 That's very good . Shall we sign a contract now ? __eou__  No problem . Let's check the terms of contract . __eou__
Excuse me . My name is Richard Davis of Magic Office Supplies . I'm here to see Mr.Chen . __eou__  Yes . He's waiting for you in his office . This way , please . __eou__
I think these patterns are quite good . Can you give me a price indication of these ? __eou__  Of course , it's my pleasure . We'll quote you the lowest price prevailing . __eou__
 Of course , it's my pleasure . We'll quote you the lowest price prevailing . __eou__  Thank you very much . If your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract . __eou__
 Here is our price list , our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery , if you can pay it within one month . we'll give you a discount of 10 % . __eou__  Very good . How many goods do you have ? __eou__
 Can you tell me how many goods you intend to order ? __eou__  We want to order 900 dozen . __eou__
 The price seems acceptable . Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ? __eou__  No problem . __eou__
We can offer you a 5 % discount . __eou__  Your price is rather out of line , much higher than we expected . We can't buy with your offer . __eou__
 Well , what do you suggest then ? How about 8 % ? __eou__  When we say your prices are much too high , we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . If we are to place an order with you . I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient . __eou__
 When we say your prices are much too high , we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . If we are to place an order with you . I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient . __eou__  What ? You want to drive me bankrupt ! You can't expect us to make such a large reduction . __eou__
 How about lo % ? This price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large . __eou__  Ok . I can settle for that . __eou__
 Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ? __eou__  This is already our best price . __eou__
 But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order . __eou__  Well , what would you suggest ? __eou__
 Could you make it $ 4500 ? __eou__  I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote . __eou__
 Can we meet each other half way ? __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ? __eou__  You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal . __eou__
 That's much higher than I expected . Can you come down a bit ? __eou__  But if you placed a larger order , we would increase the discount to 10 % . __eou__
 But if you placed a larger order , we would increase the discount to 10 % . __eou__  Supposing we agreed to your price , what payment terms could you offer us ? __eou__
 Maybe we would consider a longer credit period . __eou__  That would be nice . Let's call it a deal . __eou__
We're thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . But , there's one problem . __eou__  What's that ? I thought our negotiation went very well . __eou__
 $ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer . __eou__  I'm afraid I can't agree with you there . Your price is much higher than other companies . __eou__
 You get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable . __eou__  I don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . If you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away . __eou__
 I don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . If you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away . __eou__  Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer for this problem , let me talk to our general manager first . __eou__
 Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer for this problem , let me talk to our general manager first . __eou__  All right , we'll wait for your answer . __eou__
I'm ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to Australia . Can you do that ? __eou__  Well , I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet . So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you . __eou__
 Well , I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet . So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you . __eou__  All right , but I'm busy . How long will it be before you can finish the talk ? __eou__
 I won't be too long , I suppose . Just let me ring them , will you ? __eou__  Go ahead . __eou__
 That's right . Let's go into details of it . __eou__  Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales . __eou__
 Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales . __eou__  Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ? __eou__
 No . But in the United States , the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25 . __eou__  Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__
 I hope you can try to get them to step up production . __eou__  They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in . __eou__
 By the middle of October . This is the best we can do . __eou__  All right . I'll take your words at that . __eou__
 Good . Let's call it a deal . And we'll do our best to advance the shipment , but your letter of credit should be opened early September . __eou__  I promise . __eou__
 Thank you for visiting our products . I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so , could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ? __eou__  I'd like to , but I'm afraid that my schedule is full this week . __eou__
 What about next week ? Is it convenient for you ? __eou__  Am . How about 10 a . m . on next Friday ? __eou__
 Am . How about 10 a . m . on next Friday ? __eou__  Any time you say is OK . __eou__
Hi ! May I help you ? __eou__  Thank you ! I am interested in your product . But I am not familiar with your corporation . __eou__
 Here is our brochure . It'll help you get acquainted with our products and company . __eou__  Thank you ! __eou__
To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later . __eou__  Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June . __eou__
 Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__  Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__
 Early next month . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my L / CB __eou__  You can rest assured of that . __eou__
I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? __eou__  Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract . __eou__
 Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract . __eou__  I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation . __eou__
 I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . __eou__  All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ? __eou__
 I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . __eou__  It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . __eou__

 You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company . __eou__  Shall we leave it to the brokers ? __eou__
Thomas , could you do me a favor ? __eou__  What's up ? __eou__
 Could you pick up Mrs . David from Ford Company at the Capital Airport ? __eou__  Why don't you go ? __eou__
 Why don't you go ? __eou__  I'm supposed to do it , but the general manager called me last night . He said he couldn ’ t come back to Beijing as scheduled , so he asked me to attend the meeting for him . __eou__
 I'm supposed to do it , but the general manager called me last night . He said he couldn ’ t come back to Beijing as scheduled , so he asked me to attend the meeting for him . __eou__  I see . I'll do it for you . __eou__
 I came about your advertisement for a senior production planner . __eou__  What ’ s your name ? __eou__
 All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you 5,000 yuan a month at the start . How do you think about it ? __eou__  That's very good . __eou__
 You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job . __eou__  OK . Let me see where to start . __eou__
 Sure . You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume . __eou__  Then what else should I put into my resume ? __eou__
 Your job objectives , of course . In other words , what kind of job are you searching for ? __eou__  I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ? __eou__
 Yes . And don't forget to list them by date . Besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward . __eou__  I see . Is that all there is to it ? __eou__
 No , it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take . __eou__  Oh , good point . You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss . __eou__
 You said it . At last you ’ d better attach a list of references to your resume . __eou__  That's easy . __eou__
Could you please tell me how I can go job-hunting in the web ? __eou__  Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements . __eou__
 Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements . __eou__  How should I contact them ? __eou__

 Well , what kind of salary do you provide ? __eou__  Salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company . __eou__
 Salary can be negotiated once we officially offer you the job . __eou__  Sounds fine . __eou__
 More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . __eou__  Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ? __eou__
Can you put me through to Mr . Lining ? __eou__  Yes , speaking . Can I help you ? __eou__
 I am calling to let you know that you are selected to fill the position of Project Manager . __eou__  I am happy to hear that and I'll accept that . __eou__
 When we have the final results , we will call you . __eou__  Then when will I get a reply at the latest ? __eou__
 I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers . __eou__  I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation . __eou__
Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . __eou__  Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__
 Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__  What are they ? __eou__
 They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . __eou__  And what is the most important point ? __eou__
Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ? __eou__  Yes , but have you made an appointment ahead ? __eou__
 Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office . __eou__  Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . It is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today . __eou__
 Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . It is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . __eou__  Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? __eou__
 Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? __eou__  Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . __eou__
 Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . __eou__  I got it . Thank you so much . __eou__
 I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial . __eou__  OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you . __eou__
 That's great . You need to prepare for it . __eou__  How ? __eou__
 Buy an expensive suit . __eou__  Is a white shirt OK ? __eou__
 You should wear a tie to go with your suit . __eou__  I am afraid I would tense up during the interview . __eou__
 Don't you wish to employ RIB of ours ? US Dollars might be adopted . __eou__  Are you afraid of losing money due to exchange rate fluctuations ? __eou__
Peter , I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener . __eou__  I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . __eou__
 I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . __eou__  I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . This price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit . __eou__
 I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders .

 It's about the same . I've been thinking of making a change myself . Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university ? __eou__  No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__
I want to rent a formal suit here.Do you have a purple dress here ? __eou__  Yes . What size are you ? __eou__
 Try this on please . __eou__  This is just my size . How much is the rent __eou__
 We'll make it right with you , of course . __eou__  How about taking the damaged portion at a lower price ? __eou__
 How about taking the damaged portion at a lower price ? __eou__  What kind of price did you want ? __eou__
 I was thinking of 30 % off . __eou__  That will probably be Ok . __eou__
Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? __eou__  Go ahead , please . __eou__
 Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think for a couple of days before I give you my final answer . __eou__  Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days . __eou__
 So you should make an appointment in advance with the company for the interview . __eou__  Then how can I make the appointment ? __eou__

 Besides the resume , you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your ID card . __eou__  I see __eou__
 Also several copies of your one-inch color photos . __eou__  Yes , I have those . __eou__
 You also need to prepare formal clothes for the interview ; a suit should be the best . __eou__  I will get it soon . __eou__
 Have a briefcase ready with all your interview materials in it for easy carrying . __eou__  Ok , I will remember . __eou__
 Could you tell me about your professional education ? __eou__  B :: All right . I graduated from the nursing school of Beijing Medical University . The nursing school offered such courses as nursing science , nursing psychology , nursing ethics , internal medicine , surgery , pediatrics , and so on . __eou__
Tristan , could you stay a few extra minutes to discuss your project with me ? __eou__  Sure . We're on a pretty tight schedule , but we should be able to finish it just on time . __eou__
 Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway . __eou__  That'd be very helpful . An extra weekend is all they really need . Thanks . __eou__
 That's alright . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the new deadline . __eou__  I will . __eou__
I am calling to ask about the position of an usher . __eou__  Anything you would like to know ? __eou__
Hello , I want to apply for the position of an usher in your restaurant . __eou__  Welcome . One of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation . __eou__
 Welcome . One of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation . __eou__  What else do I need to do ? __eou__

 We will give you more than what you hope . __eou__  Really ? That's good news for me . __eou__
 Five days every week , but if it is necessary , you need to work overtime once in a while __eou__  OK , I see __eou__
 Would you please tell me about fringe benefits of the company ? __eou__  OK , we will pay insurances for employees after the probationary period . __eou__
 Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . __eou__  Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . __eou__
You know that this job requires frequent business travel . Can you accept it ? __eou__  Yes , I can . __eou__
 Mostly short business trips , but sometimes long ones are also needed . __eou__  Then how about the expenses during the trips ? __eou__
 And you need to go abroad once in a while . Can you ? __eou__  Yes , I can . __eou__
 Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home . __eou__  I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time . __eou__
 I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time . __eou__  Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock . __eou__

 I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc . __eou__  Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth . __eou__
 I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job . __eou__  So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter , especially those related to the work . __eou__

 You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely . __eou__  Certainly . __eou__

 I don't believe so.He ' s going out of town on business.May I take a message ? __eou__  I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it . __eou__

 Would you care to make another appointment ? __eou__  Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days . __eou__
 I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Do you have any problem during the process ? You should speed things up . __eou__  I have little chance to communicate with colleagues when I have problems . They are always too busy to help a green hand like me . __eou__
 And you should have good co-operation with other colleagues , you know a scientific schedule brings efficiency to the work . __eou__  I see your point , but I seem to be on bad terms with them . __eou__
 Cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better . I am speaking from my experience . __eou__  Thank you so much . __eou__
 And you should read as much as possible to enrich the knowledge . __eou__  That's a good idea . I can learn many useful things from books . __eou__
 We're approaching the critical point for success or failure of this project . you'd better speed up and catch up with books . __eou__  Well , I will do it better . __eou__
 If you have any problem in your work , let me know . __eou__  Thanks very much . I promise I will work harder . __eou__
 I have something else to remind you of . Don't be late , if you are late , you will be fined 20 Yuan per minute . __eou__  Are you kidding ? I always get up late . Oh , my God . Can't believe that . That is terrible . __eou__
 Hey , look . My admirer has struck again . __eou__  Another note ? But how ? I didn't see anyone ! __eou__
That's right . Once the contract with Stars.com is final , we'll deal with Zina . __eou__  I can't wait to see the expression on her face when we dump her . __eou__
 Don't jump the gun . She's in the driver's seat right now . You have to be patient . __eou__  Don't worry . I'm patient , but vengeance will be mine . __eou__
 If we want to beat WebTracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand . __eou__  To be honest , I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it . __eou__
 You'd rather lose to WebTracker than do things my way ? __eou__  You said it , not me . __eou__
Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about . __eou__  Zina , why are you whispering ? __eou__
 Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince . __eou__  We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose . __eou__
 We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose . __eou__  OK , but don't tell anyone what I said . __eou__
 Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__  He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__
 I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__  I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__
 Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss . __eou__  Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__
 Oh , so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself . __eou__  No , it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions . __eou__
 That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way . __eou__  We have the equal partnership in team . __eou__
 1,000 Yuan ? That's great ! So ... __eou__  OK , I know what you mean . It's my treat . __eou__
 Really ? Can I order anything I want ? __eou__  Of course . Let's go . __eou__
 First is your final conclusion on your work of this year , and then comes your plan for the next year . __eou__  Yeah , is that all ? __eou__
 Let me see , no , you have to include more details about your final conclusion , for example , your experiences in dealing with some emergent events . __eou__  That's too complicated . __eou__
 And only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report . __eou__  Oh , my God , is there any fixed for mat for it-the one that I just need to fix my information in ? __eou__
 But I don't know how to work the Microsoft Words . Could you please give me a hand ? __eou__  OK , no problem . But you have to learn it and then do it yourself next time . __eou__
 Ah , good morning , Mr . Smith . Nice to meet you . I'm Peter Anderson from Personnel . Do sit down . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 No , I haven't . I'm awfully sorry . Can I send them to you ? __eou__  Yes , that'll be all right . Well , please tell me about your working experience . __eou__
 Yes , that'll be all right . Well , please tell me about your working experience . __eou__  I haven't been involved in international business , so I don't have any experiences , but I am diligent and I learn very fast . __eou__
 Yes , in most circumstances.Are you available for business travel ? __eou__  Yes , I am young , and unmarried . It's no problem for me to travel frequently . __eou__
 OK . You are good . Hope to see you next time . I'll call you if you get picked for next test . __eou__  Thank you very much . I'm looking forward to your call . __eou__
 You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . __eou__  Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . __eou__
 2 should be enough , for each one has at least 30 seats . There will be some seats to spare . __eou__  I'll call the bus charter later . And have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ? __eou__
 Let me think ! Pills for carsick , traditional medicine for cold , some painkillers and something like that . __eou__  OK , we should get them ready this afternoon . __eou__
 One more thing , have you got all people's phone numbers ? __eou__  Oh , God . I've almost forgotten . I'll get it done right away . __eou__
Would you like me to type it for you ? __eou__  Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? __eou__
 Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? __eou__  Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . __eou__
 Shall I right out again first ? __eou__  No , there ’ s no need . __eou__
 Can I print it ? __eou__  No , don ’ t bother . It ’ s all right as it is . __eou__
 Why don't you find someone who is in the know . __eou__  I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . __eou__
 Did you ask his former sectary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . __eou__  Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . __eou__
May I come in , Mr Sun ? __eou__  I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now . __eou__
 Can I try later then ? __eou__  Yes , of course . __eou__
 Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ? __eou__  Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ? __eou__
 Do you mind if I sit down ? __eou__  Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? __eou__
 I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? __eou__  Yes . But why should you want to do that ? __eou__
 Do you mind if I speak frankly ? __eou__  Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__
 Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? __eou__  Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did . __eou__
Well , thank you . Mr.Parry , for all your information . Just one more question . __eou__  Yes , sir ? __eou__
 Well , thank you again for coming to see us . But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams . __eou__  Certainly , sir . __eou__
 Would you like me to go with you ? __eou__  I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things . __eou__

 I ’ d rather you typed it . __eou__  Do you want to tell her ? __eou__
 He is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him . __eou__  What's up ? __eou__
Have you found another job yet , Sally ? __eou__  No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . __eou__

 You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours . __eou__  How much is the salary ? __eou__
 Well , I'm very interested in the job . __eou__  Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow . __eou__
 Oh , yes . Arm , well , could you tell me your name , please ? __eou__  Oh , Candida Fawcett . __eou__

 I hope you're not turning into a sissy on me , Dave . __eou__  Look , I want to succeed just as much as you do . Well , maybe not quite that much . __eou__
 If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail . __eou__  What are you trying to say ? __eou__
May I come in , Mr Sun ? __eou__  I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now . __eou__
 Can I try later then ? __eou__  Yes , of course . __eou__
 Do you mind if I sit down ? __eou__  Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? __eou__
 I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? __eou__  Yes . But why should you want to do that ? __eou__

 Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? __eou__  Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did . __eou__
I want to offer you more invoking stock options . __eou__  When you hired me , you knew you were going to be low on cash , didn't you ? __eou__
 Zina . Look , I know when I hired you , I told you I'd pay you a salary . But I just can't . __eou__  Excuse me ? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard . __eou__
 I know it's awkward , but you're going to be thanking me later . I'm going to make you rich . __eou__  You're going to make me rich by not paying me ? __eou__

Hey Lisa ... want to grab lunch with me ? __eou__  Sure , Emily . We haven't done that in a while . __eou__
 I don't mind really.Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory . __eou__  Well , I know Brown's Biscuit Factory are looking for a porter.They pay $ 200 a week . __eou__
No , Dave . I haven't wrecked my jeep . I'm calling to offer you a job . __eou__  With invoking ? No , thanks . __eou__
 I'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building . __eou__  I'm not interested , Zina . __eou__
 Don't play hard to get . The pay is good . You'd be working with Elvin again . __eou__  I don't think so . __eou__
Hey , Ken ... I need to talk to you . __eou__  Sure ... what's up ? __eou__
 Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation . __eou__  Sure ... __eou__
 Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . __eou__  Interesting idea . You might be on to something . __eou__
OK , let's find somebody then . __eou__  Good . I'll take care of it . __eou__
 Wait a second , Vince . You know what ? Why don't you let me handle it ? __eou__  Are you sure ? Do you have somebody in mind ? __eou__
 OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin . __eou__  Don't sweat it . I know just the guy . __eou__
 You wouldn't do that . Would you ? __eou__  I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy . __eou__
 Can I spy on you guys from the window ? __eou__  No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince . __eou__
 Look , before we get into the secret admirer thing , I want to talk to you about WebTracker . __eou__  I'm sorry . I know you feel betrayed . __eou__
Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you . __eou__  Like who ? __eou__
 What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? __eou__  That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no . __eou__
Vince . We're both busy , so I'm not going to beat around the bush . I need a raise . __eou__  I can't do that , Zina . You know I can't . __eou__
 Bull . I're done my research . I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options . __eou__  Who told you that ? __eou__
I'm really confused , Zina . Will you explain all this to me ? __eou__  Look , we need to have the Stars.com account , right ? __eou__
 Hi , Nacy.Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books . __eou__  So , you are leaving , aren't you ? __eou__
 Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ? __eou__  Oh . all right I'll read it soon . __eou__
Excuse me sir.May I come in ? __eou__  Mike , you're late again . __eou__
 Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。 __eou__  I promise I will . __eou__
 Please , give me one more chance . I'll never let it happen again .

 I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs . __eou__  Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday . __eou__
 Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing . __eou__  I think I would like that . __eou__

 You should try it.It ' s a great game . Come on , let me help you . I'm a good player , and a good teacher , too.What do you say ? __eou__  OK , but don't say I didn't warn you . __eou__
 Let me help you with your serve . __eou__  No one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before.Maybe I should learn to do something . __eou__
 Well , maybe not a Michael Zhang , but better than the average . Person would you like to play again Wednesday ? __eou__  Yes . This has been fun . __eou__
 Yes . I had a look just now . I found some of the exhibits of excellent quality and beautiful design . I feel we __eou__  Sure we can . You know , we've been in this line for more than twenty years . __eou__
 Good . We can hold more talks later on to iron out the details . __eou__  Sure . __eou__
I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . __eou__  Is that so ? __eou__
 Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . __eou__  Have you decided ? __eou__
 Yes , I want to get a better job . __eou__  Could you tell me why you want to quit ? __eou__
 Could you tell me why you want to quit ? __eou__  I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . __eou__
 Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I'm sure something can be worked out . __eou__  I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mr . Yang . I'm Jill , Mr . Smith's secretary . Would you like to look around the factory first ? __eou__  Yes , I would . __eou__
 Now this is our office block . We have all the administrative departments Sales , Accounting , Personnel , Market Research and so on . __eou__  What's that building opposite us ? __eou__
 The steel sheets and bars come in , as you see , in different sizes and are unloaded onto the delivery bay here . We buy them in from a steel works in Wales . This is the new conveyor belt we installed last year . We doubled our output in this department as a result . __eou__  Oh , really ? __eou__
 Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look . __eou__  Are the prices on the list firm offers ? __eou__
 What we will do is to strengthen it . __eou__  Yes , this is also the competitive edge of our company . __eou__
 If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . __eou__  What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . __eou__
 I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? __eou__  What's your proposal ? __eou__
 Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . __eou__  Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! __eou__
 The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go . __eou__  That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . __eou__
 That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . __eou__  OK . We can meet halfway again . __eou__
Mr . Smith . could you give me your quotation for your bicycle A5 , FOB Qingdao ? __eou__  Can You tell me how many you want to buy ? __eou__
 Since this is a sizeable order , I was thinking you might give us a 5 % discount . __eou__  I'm afraid we can't go as high as that . You know we usually don't give any discount . but considering the newly established business relationship between us , I could give you 3 % off the list price . __eou__
 I'm afraid we can't go as high as that . You know we usually don't give any discount . but considering the newly established business relationship between us , I could give you 3 % off the list price . __eou__  Only 3 % ? That's not much . If you could make some concessions , we would probably buy some of your other products . __eou__
 Only 3 % ? That's not much . If you could make some concessions , we would probably buy some of your other products . __eou__  OK . OK . I don't want to haggle with you . Let's say , how about 3.5 % ? __eou__
 OK . OK . I don't want to haggle with you . Let's say , how about 3.5 % ? __eou__  I think I can accept that . __eou__
Here's our sample room . __eou__  You've got a large collection of sample foodstuffs here . __eou__

 If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . __eou__  How ? __eou__
 You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start .

Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? __eou__  What is the problem ? __eou__
 I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . __eou__  It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . __eou__

Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__
 Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__  Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__
 Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . __eou__  A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language . __eou__
 Neither , I prefer an active job . __eou__  Then how about a salesman ? __eou__
 Then how about a salesman ? __eou__  That's better . I like travelling . __eou__
 I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . __eou__  Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . __eou__

 Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . __eou__  Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . __eou__

Tomorrow is my day off . I wonder if it's convenient to change our appointment from tomorrow to next Wednesday , still at the same time . __eou__  I'm afraid I won't be free next week . __eou__
 It's a shame.Will this afternoon be all right ? But I can only spare you an hour and a half today , from four o'clock . __eou__  That's OK . __eou__

I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed . __eou__  What a pity ! __eou__
 If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? __eou__  That's OK . __eou__

 Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken . __eou__  All that's left is a leg . I gave the head to Tim ! __eou__
 I'm looking for someone who works here , but I lost his business card . His name's Long or Sang or something like that . __eou__  Chang ? __eou__
 I'll call him and tell him you're here . __eou__  I appreciate your help . __eou__
Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? __eou__  Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . __eou__
 Actually , there's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did . __eou__  What is it ? Tell me ! Will it work for Lester , too ? __eou__
 I think so ! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week . That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you ! __eou__  Hmm . Are you sure that will work ? I already tried giving chocolate to Lester . __eou__
See how many people are here ! __eou__  Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here ! __eou__
 Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing ! __eou__  Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! __eou__
Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith . __eou__  I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment . __eou__
 The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number . __eou__  Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ? __eou__
 Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ? __eou__  Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w . __eou__
 Well , there are still some consolation prizes . We can go up to the front and pick them up . __eou__  So , what did you win ? __eou__
 Look at Vivian ! She thinks she's the cat's meow ! __eou__  Why don't you go talk to her and find out what her secret was this year . __eou__
Melanie , can you help me with something ? We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and , I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English . __eou__  Sure Tracy , let me just get my laptop . __eou__
 Sure Tracy , let me just get my laptop . __eou__  Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing . __eou__
 Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... __eou__  Okay , more relaxed . Got it . Hey , Sally , what ' s up ? It's Tracy here , just . __eou__
 Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms . Cooper , I'm writing to confirm ... ? __eou__  Great , okay . " Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine " . __eou__
 " The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB . We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... " __eou__  Woo , okay , back up a second , Tracy . That's too direct . Can I suggest you say , please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication ? You don't want to offend her . __eou__
 Woo , okay , back up a second , Tracy . That's too direct . Can I suggest you say , please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication ? You don't want to offend her . __eou__  Oops , okay . You are right . Then I can just end with " All the best , Tracy " . __eou__
 Mmmm , maybe , but I'd play it safe and just finish with " Yours Sincerely " . That's more professional . __eou__  Oh , Melanie , you are a life saver , thank you ! __eou__
I've just got Bean's new brand image . Let's make a T-shirt line with these pics . __eou__  Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie ! __eou__
Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? __eou__  Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . __eou__
 Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . __eou__  That sounds ideal . __eou__
Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? __eou__  I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . __eou__
 Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . __eou__  Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? __eou__
 Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that sound ? __eou__  That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . __eou__
 Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__  Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? __eou__
 Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? __eou__  Yes , of course . That ’ s quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also . __eou__
Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . __eou__  Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__
 Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__  Yes , please . __eou__
 Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . __eou__  Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . __eou__
 I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . __eou__  What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? __eou__
Good afternoon . May I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I ’ m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four . __eou__  Certainly , may I take your name ? I ’ ll let her know you ’ Ve arrived . __eou__
 Certainly , may I take your name ? I ’ ll let her know you ’ Ve arrived . __eou__  Sure , it ’ s Josh O ’ Neil . __eou__
 Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ? __eou__  Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you . __eou__
So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . __eou__  Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__
Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something . __eou__  Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ? __eou__
 Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ? __eou__  Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . __eou__
 Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . __eou__  You wanna take some time off , is that right ? __eou__
 Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . __eou__  What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . __eou__
 What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . __eou__  I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? __eou__
 I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? __eou__  Well , I guess so . __eou__
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . __eou__  You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? __eou__
 I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! __eou__  I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . __eou__
 Yes , this is Julianne Horton , and I ’ m calling to arrange an appointment with Ms . McNeal . __eou__  Certainly , what day were you thinking of ? __eou__
 Um . . . let me double check . . . unfortunately , she ’ s booked solid on Thursday , how does next Monday work for you ? __eou__  Actually , I ’ Ve got something scheduled on Monday . Can she do Tuesday ? __eou__
 Actually , I ’ Ve got something scheduled on Monday . Can she do Tuesday ? __eou__  Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ? __eou__
 Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ? __eou__  Sure , Merton Financial Advisors . __eou__
 Just give me a second . I'll be right up . I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! __eou__  But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus . __eou__
 Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . __eou__  Ok . Anything else ? __eou__
 Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer ! __eou__  Um yeah . Sorry about that . __eou__
I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . __eou__  Is that so ? __eou__
 Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . __eou__  Have you decided ? __eou__
 Yes , I want to get a better job . __eou__  Could you tell me why you want to quit ? __eou__
 Could you tell me why you want to quit ? __eou__  I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . __eou__
 Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I " m sure something can be worked out . __eou__  I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . __eou__
Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ? __eou__  Well ... I'm pretty busy . but ... all right . come in . What can I do for you ? __eou__
 Do you mind if I sit down ? __eou__  Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ? __eou__
 I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? __eou__  Yes , but why should you want to do that ? __eou__
 Do you mind if I speak frankly ? __eou__  Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__
 Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? __eou__  Yes . I'd delighted if you did . __eou__
John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you . __eou__  Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . __eou__
 No . Come here right now . __eou__  OK . __eou__
 I'm sorry to say that we have to let you go , John . __eou__  Why ? I work very hard . __eou__
 We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . __eou__  OK . I need to think about that for a while . __eou__
 OK . I need to think about that for a while . __eou__  All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day . __eou__
 Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__  He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__
 I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__  I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__
 Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . __eou__  Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__
 Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . __eou__  I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? __eou__
If we are to modernize our information processing , manufacturing system and management code , we need to complete our office automation . __eou__  Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible . __eou__
 Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible . __eou__  Our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently . To improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space . __eou__
 Our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently . To improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space . __eou__  Good . We can contact the Tiana Office Furniture Store , and ask them to install computers in our company , deliver new tables and other furniture to match the function of the computers , and to improve our work atmosphere simultaneously . __eou__
May I come in ? __eou__  Come in , please . __eou__
 Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . __eou__  You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? __eou__
 I got the message . I'm quiting . __eou__  Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . __eou__
Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days . __eou__  That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ? __eou__
 Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off . __eou__  That's long leave . How's your project coming along ? __eou__
 The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . __eou__  Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . __eou__
 Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . __eou__  Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . __eou__
 Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . __eou__  I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . __eou__
 Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone . __eou__  Oh , Thank you very much ! __eou__
 Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over there is the sales department . __eou__  Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . __eou__
 Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . __eou__  It looks like you guys work hard . __eou__
 Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . __eou__  Sure thing . __eou__
 Yes , we just got it and it is fabulous . Well , first you have to turn this switch on . __eou__  Silly me ! __eou__
 I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . __eou__  I guess you think twice next time he comes . __eou__
 Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming . __eou__  Well , I know you do the right thing . __eou__
good morning ! __eou__  good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? __eou__
 I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! __eou__  that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . __eou__
 that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . __eou__  I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . __eou__
 I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . __eou__  what's that ? __eou__
 well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . __eou__  that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . __eou__
 that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . __eou__  for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? __eou__
 just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . __eou__  do you have any other plans this weekend ? __eou__
 I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . __eou__  try not to take on more than you can handle . __eou__
 yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary . __eou__  that's really cool ! I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet , seeing something unique . __eou__
 that's really cool ! I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet , seeing something unique . __eou__  great minds think alike . My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time . Do you have anything on your schedule ? __eou__
 nothing particular . __eou__  why don't you join us ? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare . __eou__
 oh , Tibet sounds great , but I'm afraid it'll cost too much . Last time I traveled to India , and it cost me a fortune . __eou__  come on ! We're traveling on our own . It won't cost too much . __eou__
 the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap . __eou__  then make sure that you book me a room , too . __eou__
 I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . __eou__  as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? __eou__
 well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . __eou__  you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . __eou__
 I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! __eou__  you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . __eou__
 to be honest , I was just dumped . __eou__  oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up . __eou__
 I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . __eou__  well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ? __eou__
 not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours . __eou__  what's there to see ? __eou__
 there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes . __eou__  oh , sounds nice . __eou__
 oh , sounds nice . __eou__  yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like . __eou__
 I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . __eou__  oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? __eou__
 no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . __eou__  we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . __eou__
What a nice day ! __eou__  yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? __eou__
 hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . __eou__  exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__
 exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__  yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! __eou__
 yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! __eou__  why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . __eou__
 ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . __eou__  wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . __eou__
 not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__  oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? __eou__
 well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found his extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , a __eou__  it seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__
 there's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar h __eou__  well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you as me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . __eou__
 well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you as me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . __eou__  I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__
 I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__  yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__
 I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . __eou__  really ? What do the companies do that for ? __eou__
 I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__  oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . __eou__
 oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . __eou__  exactly . __eou__
 exactly . __eou__  do we need an appointment beforehand ? __eou__
 I must have taken a wrong turn . __eou__  it doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it . __eou__
 thanks a lot . __eou__  you ’ re welcome . __eou__
 you ’ re welcome . __eou__  by the way , how long does it take ? __eou__
 without traffic , it takes about an hour . __eou__  I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ? __eou__
 yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time . __eou__  great ! Thank you ! __eou__
 great ! Thank you ! __eou__  my pleasure , and have a good time ! __eou__
 yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . __eou__  is she American ? __eou__
 yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! __eou__  so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? __eou__
 I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . __eou__  sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? __eou__
 not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . __eou__  that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? __eou__
 you bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . __eou__  good luck ! __eou__
 good luck ! __eou__  thanks ! __eou__
 it was wonderful , but I was so tired . __eou__  did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? __eou__
 yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there . __eou__  what else did you see ? __eou__
 art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . __eou__  you must have had a great time . __eou__
 yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . __eou__  yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__
 yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__  on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems . __eou__
 on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems . __eou__  that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . __eou__
 that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . __eou__  you'll have to try for yourself some day . __eou__
Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . __eou__  is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? __eou__
 yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . __eou__  I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? __eou__
 yeah , that's nice . __eou__  hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__
 hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__  a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? __eou__
 a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? __eou__  I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__
 I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__  I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . __eou__
 just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . __eou__  congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! __eou__
 I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . __eou__  if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . __eou__
 if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . __eou__  how big is a shuffle iPod ? __eou__
 the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first . __eou__  how many gigs of music can it hold ? __eou__
 I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember . __eou__  how much do they cost ? __eou__
 not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars . __eou__  you're right , that's not bad at all . __eou__
 you're right , that's not bad at all . __eou__  do you have an iPod ? __eou__
 I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one . __eou__  why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ? __eou__
 I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer . __eou__  do you know what camcorder options are available ? __eou__
 not really . I thought I'd just have a look today . __eou__  would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ? __eou__
 it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes . __eou__  can you also take still photos with this ? __eou__
 yes , that is an option . __eou__  how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ? __eou__
 yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark . __eou__  that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ? __eou__
 It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera . __eou__  how does that compare with other models ? __eou__
 there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one . __eou__  I guess you can't have everything , can you ? __eou__
 not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though . __eou__  what's wrong ? __eou__
 I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline . __eou__  Are you using dial-up or broadband ? __eou__
 actually , I've got a wireless connection . __eou__  In that case , you need to turn on your airport . __eou__
 I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that . __eou__  do you like ever chat online ? __eou__
 No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? __eou__  Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it . __eou__
 well , you can always block them . When I don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what I do . __eou__  what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list . __eou__
 it's aubreyinchina@yahoo.com . __eou__  cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help . __eou__
You wouldn't believe what I got in the mail today ! __eou__  what's that ? __eou__
 it's a letter from Ray and Sue in Shanghai ! __eou__  have you read it yet ? __eou__
 no , I thought I'd wait until you got home . __eou__  go on , read it out loud . __eou__
 ok . It says , " Dear Jessica . It was so good to receive you letter . I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease ... " __eou__  when did you send her a letter ? __eou__
 just a few weeks ago . Sue and I send letters to each other often . __eou__  I didn't know anyone did that any more . Ok , go on . __eou__
 ok ... I'm going to have to skip over this section . It's girl-talk . __eou__  that's fine with me . __eou__
 that's fine with me . __eou__  oh . It's actually all rather personal . __eou__
 oh . It's actually all rather personal . __eou__  well , skip over all of that and read me the rest . __eou__
 ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... " Ray and I look forward to seeing you in June . Write soon . With love , Sue . " __eou__  are we going to see them in June or are they coming to see us ? __eou__
 didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June . __eou__  oh , I guess I missed that . __eou__
 oh , I guess I missed that . __eou__  men ! __eou__
 yes , it's got wireless Internet access . __eou__  that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? __eou__
 no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . __eou__  yes , I guess I should try to use it . __eou__
 yes , I guess I should try to use it . __eou__  does it have a camera ? __eou__
 I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message . __eou__  oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet . __eou__
 oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet . __eou__  do you want to listen to your messages first ? __eou__
 I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone . __eou__  I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ? __eou__
 it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet . __eou__  how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ? __eou__
 it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time ! __eou__  let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age ! __eou__
 I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games . __eou__  how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ? __eou__
 the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned ! __eou__  if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it . __eou__
 I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions ! __eou__  I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! __eou__
 I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! __eou__  hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube . __eou__
 I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! __eou__  I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . __eou__
 I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . __eou__  if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . __eou__
 if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . __eou__  let's get started with this game then . __eou__
 pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . __eou__  if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__
 if I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . __eou__  will you get a pay-raise , too ? __eou__
 whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . __eou__  that makes sense . Who interviewed you ? __eou__
 my boss . __eou__  what kinds of questions did she ask you ? __eou__
 she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . __eou__  the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? __eou__
 I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . __eou__  those are good answers . How did she react ? __eou__
 she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . __eou__  what do you think about her as a boss ? __eou__
 she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . __eou__  you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__
 you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__  that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__
 that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__  when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__
 well , you are a very hard-worker . __eou__  I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . __eou__
 I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . __eou__  there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? __eou__
 of course . It's be against the law if we didn't . __eou__  that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it . __eou__
 don't I know you ? __eou__  yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school . __eou__
 yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school . __eou__  you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! __eou__
 you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! __eou__  What did you do after high school ? __eou__
 I took a year off to go travelling . __eou__  that sounds exciting . Where did you go ? __eou__
 I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department . __eou__  Oh , did you study a foreign language ? __eou__
 yes , I got a grant to study Chinese . __eou__  that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? __eou__
 it is , but it's very rewarding . __eou__  so you can speak Chinese ? __eou__
 I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die ! __eou__  I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well . __eou__
 I'm off to Barcelona for a week . __eou__  do you have your passport with you ? __eou__
 let me see here ... yes , there's one left . __eou__  ok . I'll take that one then . __eou__
 I like to travel light so I just have this one . __eou__  if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? __eou__
I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend . __eou__  oh . __eou__
 oh . __eou__  don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ? __eou__
 sure . __eou__  I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do it get on the train tonight a __eou__
 oh , no . We've brought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable . __eou__  will the train be very crowded ? __eou__
 oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . __eou__  when is the first meeting then ? __eou__
 they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . That should give you enough time to have a quick shower . __eou__  where will I be staying ? __eou__
 we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system . __eou__  that's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? __eou__
 I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . __eou__  where are you planning on going ? __eou__
 I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away . __eou__  since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number . __eou__
Hey , Frank , there is that Janet Check . __eou__  Wow , what a great burd ! __eou__
 Wow , what a great burd ! __eou__  She sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__
 She sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__  She's a real turn-on our rights . __eou__
 She's a real turn-on our rights . __eou__  And look out she's dressed . __eou__
 No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . __eou__  Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . __eou__
 Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . __eou__  I think you've lost it . __eou__
 I think you've lost it . __eou__  Well , that's my opinion . __eou__
 Well , that's my opinion . __eou__  I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . __eou__
 I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . __eou__  Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . __eou__
 Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . __eou__  At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . __eou__
 it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! __eou__  where did you end up going ? __eou__
 because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . __eou__  I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? __eou__
 oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . __eou__  you don't look very happy in that picture . __eou__
 no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! __eou__  so what did you do ? __eou__
 we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . __eou__  my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? __eou__
 of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . __eou__  that's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . __eou__
 no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce . __eou__  oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__
 oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__  yeah . I found it is so close to our life . __eou__
 yeah . I found it is so close to our life . __eou__  it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__
 it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__  you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . __eou__
 you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . __eou__  well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . __eou__
 well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . __eou__  I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__
 I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__  oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__
 oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__  that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . __eou__
 that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . __eou__  I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage . __eou__
 I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage . __eou__  definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__
 definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__  in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__
 in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__  I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . __eou__
 I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . __eou__  Then let's go in . __eou__
 I'll say the movie's starting in the minute . __eou__  I know . I wonder what's keeping him . __eou__
 I know . I wonder what's keeping him . __eou__  Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? __eou__
 Yeah , a number of times . __eou__  What's he trying to pull anyway . __eou__
 What's he trying to pull anyway . __eou__  I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . __eou__
 I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . __eou__  Maybe you should start seeing someone else . __eou__
more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners . __eou__  that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners . __eou__
 that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners . __eou__  oh , why ? __eou__
 I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them . __eou__  I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples . __eou__
 I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples . __eou__  well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ? __eou__
 I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men . __eou__  or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men . __eou__
 or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men . __eou__  what do you mean ? __eou__
 you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl . __eou__  a left girl ? What's that ? __eou__
 they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , __eou__  you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love . __eou__
 you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love . __eou__  that ' for sure but very few . __eou__
 not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . __eou__  let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? __eou__
 you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . __eou__  I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . __eou__
 I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . __eou__  oh , how did you deal with it ? __eou__
 I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . __eou__  oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? __eou__
 simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . __eou__  like what ? __eou__
 he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . __eou__  Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . __eou__
 Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . __eou__  yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . __eou__
 yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . __eou__  so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . __eou__
 so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . __eou__  not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . __eou__
hi , betty ! __eou__  hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ? __eou__
 pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great . __eou__  that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ? __eou__
 well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don __eou__  that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . __eou__
 that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . __eou__  indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees . __eou__
 indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees . __eou__  that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . __eou__
 that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . __eou__  true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything . __eou__
 true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything . __eou__  well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . __eou__
 well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . __eou__  yeah it is . __eou__
 great . My family came to visit me . __eou__  oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? __eou__
 my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . __eou__  I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . __eou__
 I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . __eou__  I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? __eou__
 yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . __eou__  interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__
 the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da __eou__  do you get along well with each other ? __eou__
 yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . __eou__  you are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__
 you are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__  thank you . __eou__
this party rocks ! __eou__  you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! __eou__
 yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! __eou__  I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . __eou__
 I can see five other guys eying her up . __eou__  okay , here I go ! __eou__
 okay , here I go ! __eou__  good luck ! __eou__
 sure , I am a total internet junkie , I can't survive without internet . __eou__  really ? What do you usually do online ? __eou__
 well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly I chat online . You could say I'm addicted to online chatting . __eou__  I never chatted online before . What's it like . __eou__
 I never chatted online before . What's it like . __eou__  well , basically it's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . You should try it at least once . __eou__
 to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were __eou__  that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home . __eou__
 that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home . __eou__  well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . You know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . There are a lot of per __eou__
 just after 2 am . __eou__  what's wrong ? Can't sleep ? __eou__
 I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? __eou__  I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ? __eou__
 me too . But I think I am going to bed now . my head is getting heavy . Have a nice day there ! __eou__  thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams ! __eou__
 thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams ! __eou__  talk to you later . __eou__
 well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . __eou__  what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . __eou__
 what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . __eou__  oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? __eou__
 art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . __eou__  really impressive . These two genres are totally different . __eou__
 really impressive . These two genres are totally different . __eou__  sure . I enjoy both of them very much . __eou__
 sure . I enjoy both of them very much . __eou__  how often do you go to the cinema ? __eou__
 once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon . __eou__  movie salon ? where is that ? __eou__
 it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there . __eou__  is it good ? __eou__
 yes , you can find almost all new releases there . __eou__  really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership . __eou__
hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it . __eou__  is it a horror movie ? __eou__
 that's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . __eou__  Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ? __eou__
 Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . __eou__  that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . __eou__
 that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . __eou__  yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . __eou__
 yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . __eou__  not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . __eou__
 not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . __eou__  the Notebook is this type of movie . __eou__
 the Notebook is this type of movie . __eou__  really ? I haven't heard of it . __eou__
 I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__  you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__
 you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__  I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__
 I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__  you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you __eou__
 you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you __eou__  a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__
 a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__  then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__
our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . __eou__  really ? Where did you hear that ? __eou__
 I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__  no , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__
 no , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__  that's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__
 Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__  well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__
 well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__  no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t __eou__
 no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t __eou__  well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost b __eou__
 it's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . __eou__  well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? __eou__
 don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . __eou__  you're dancing so well . __eou__
 you're dancing so well . __eou__  you dance beautifully too . __eou__
 you dance beautifully too . __eou__  when did you learn to dance ? __eou__
 it's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . __eou__  how about tango ? __eou__
 Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . __eou__  thank you for the dance . __eou__
 thank you for the dance . __eou__  my pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__
I really admire you , Diana . __eou__  why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . __eou__
 you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . __eou__  I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__
 I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__  isn't there anything else ? __eou__
 I have no idea . __eou__  you must have a high IQ score . __eou__
 you must have a high IQ score . __eou__  well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . __eou__
 my IQ score is slightly above average . __eou__  seriously ? But you are such a genius . __eou__
 maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__  well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__
 well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__  you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__
 you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__  oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__
hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door . __eou__  oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . __eou__
 oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . __eou__  nice to meet you too . __eou__
 nice to meet you too . __eou__  would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice . __eou__
 oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well . __eou__  oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . __eou__
 oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . __eou__  you are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants __eou__
 you are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants __eou__  there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . __eou__
 there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . __eou__  well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . __eou__
 to be honest , I wouldn't . __eou__  why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? __eou__
 not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . __eou__  what's the puzzle ? __eou__
 my husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . __eou__  oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . __eou__
 oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . __eou__  yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . __eou__
 yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . __eou__  oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . __eou__
 oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . __eou__  but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . __eou__
 but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . __eou__  definitely . __eou__
 definitely . __eou__  you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . __eou__
 you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . __eou__  don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . __eou__
 don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . __eou__  I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . __eou__
 I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . __eou__  sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . __eou__
 I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . __eou__  what would it be like ? __eou__
 well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . __eou__  how many rooms would it have ? __eou__
 I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t __eou__  how many bedrooms would your dream home have ? __eou__
 I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . __eou__  how would you decorate your house ? __eou__
 I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b __eou__  how many TVs would your dream home have ? __eou__
what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! __eou__  that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . __eou__
 cheese ... __eou__  did it come out ? __eou__
 yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . __eou__  never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again . __eou__
finally we're on board ! __eou__  yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . __eou__
 let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle seat . __eou__  ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . __eou__
 I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . __eou__  good idea . __eou__
 good idea . __eou__  don't forget to keep the seat belt on . __eou__
 yes ! __eou__  and no hijackers . __eou__
 and no hijackers . __eou__  oh , you have too wild of an imagination . __eou__
 thanks . __eou__  are you also going to Beijing ? __eou__
 yes , I went there once last summer . __eou__  really ? What did you think ? __eou__
 I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . __eou__  was it that crowded ? __eou__
 yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans . __eou__  oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . __eou__
 oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . __eou__  that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! __eou__
 that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! __eou__  thank you very much ! __eou__
 Fine , thank you , sir . It ’ s nice to see you again . __eou__  Good to see you again , too . How ’ s you family ? __eou__
 I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back . __eou__  Where were you ? __eou__
 it's got to be almost a year now . __eou__  how have you been ? __eou__
 I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . __eou__  yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? __eou__
 not yet . I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . __eou__  well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? __eou__
 it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . __eou__  what is it like living in on-campus housing ? __eou__
 it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . __eou__  did you have to pay a deposit ? __eou__
 no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . __eou__  do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? __eou__
 no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . __eou__  how long is your contract for ? __eou__
 that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . __eou__  have you started looking again yet ? __eou__
 not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . __eou__  Good luck ! __eou__
 no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . __eou__  but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . __eou__
 but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . __eou__  we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . __eou__
 we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . __eou__  can't you hang out with them , too ? __eou__
 I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . __eou__  maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . __eou__
 I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . __eou__  it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . __eou__
 it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . __eou__  you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . __eou__
 you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . __eou__  she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__
 I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . __eou__  I still think you two should try to patch things up . __eou__
 my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . __eou__  three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! __eou__
 three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! __eou__  well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . __eou__
 well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . __eou__  were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? __eou__
 I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . __eou__  did your husband's family get to meet your family ? __eou__
 my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t __eou__  that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? __eou__
 we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . __eou__  you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? __eou__
 it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__  oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__
 he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__  sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__
 he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__  oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? __eou__
 he didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__  maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__
 maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__  oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? __eou__
 come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . __eou__  thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . __eou__
 thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . __eou__  that's what friends are for . __eou__
you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander . __eou__  thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight . __eou__
 thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight . __eou__  how did you meet each other ? __eou__
 she's a friend of Amy . We met at Amy's birthday party . __eou__  is this your first date ? __eou__
 yes . I hope it pans out . Cross your fingers , Lily . __eou__  sure it will . Oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . I'm going to be late for my date . __eou__
 sure it will . Oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . I'm going to be late for my date . __eou__  oh ... so you buried the hatchet with Steven ? __eou__
 absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history ! __eou__  then who will you meet tonight ? __eou__
 a guy I met on the internet three month ago . __eou__  really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ? __eou__
 please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday . __eou__  I know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information . __eou__
 hey , Isabelle ... __eou__  Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__  yes , I am the guy . __eou__
 yes , I am the guy . __eou__  what a bummer ! You set me up ? __eou__
 how dare you ! __eou__  hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! __eou__
 hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! __eou__  why did you lie to me in the email ? __eou__
 I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . __eou__  I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . __eou__
 I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . __eou__  I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . __eou__
 waiting for someone . __eou__  you mean the boy you met on MSN ? __eou__
 you're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . __eou__  you must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! __eou__
 I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . __eou__  I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . __eou__
 well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . __eou__  did you tell him ? __eou__
 yes . He said I'm his dream girl . __eou__  you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . __eou__
 you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . __eou__  I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . __eou__
 I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . __eou__  I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . __eou__
 I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__  but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__
 they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__  so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__
 sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small desert . __eou__  how about drinking soda ? __eou__
 many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try __eou__  that's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__
 my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__  how do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__
I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . __eou__  do you have any other symptoms ? __eou__
 yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . __eou__  how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? __eou__
 no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . __eou__  how did you get that burn again ? __eou__
 I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . __eou__  you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? __eou__
 no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . __eou__  when's the last time you took your tablets ? __eou__
 I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . __eou__  I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ? __eou__
 not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . __eou__  why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . __eou__
 I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . __eou__  it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? __eou__
 just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . __eou__  I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . Let's go . __eou__
 the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . __eou__  the Taj it is then . __eou__
 they'll still charge us a corkage fee . __eou__  that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . __eou__
 that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . __eou__  don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . __eou__
hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . __eou__  that depends . What is it ? __eou__
 it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans __eou__  I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . __eou__
 we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__  that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__
 I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__  really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__
 really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__  do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__
 when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . __eou__  has anything else happened to you ? __eou__
 nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__  well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . __eou__
 sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it . __eou__  do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it . __eou__
 I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . __eou__  are you very close to your first-cousins ? __eou__
 the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . __eou__  I see . who ’ s the head of your household ? __eou__
 it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . __eou__  that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? __eou__
 at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . __eou__  that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . __eou__
 Actually , i popped in them last night . __eou__  OK , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ? __eou__
 Well , they're really beautiful people . __eou__  I'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ? __eou__
 Yeah , she is a neck-off for sure . __eou__  And he looks like a typical jog . __eou__
 And he looks like a typical jog . __eou__  He is a professional football player . __eou__
 He is a professional football player . __eou__  Ah-ha , I thought so . __eou__
 Ah-ha , I thought so . __eou__  Anyway , that is not what I meant by beautiful . __eou__
 Anyway , that is not what I meant by beautiful . __eou__  What did you mean ? __eou__
 I meant that they're very simple , easy to talk to . __eou__  That's right . __eou__
 That's right . __eou__  Yeah . I think things are worked out just fine . __eou__
 it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through __eou__  would you want to live there ? __eou__
 I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro __eou__  what's your dreamhole like then ? __eou__
 my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England . __eou__  would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? __eou__
 old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . __eou__  it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ? __eou__
 no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! __eou__  I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? __eou__
 It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts . __eou__  I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ? __eou__
 She made another white crack about my clothes . __eou__  Are you sure she was trying to put you down ? __eou__
 Of course , I am sure . __eou__  You shall go easy on her . she is new here . __eou__
 There are 15 people in my family . __eou__  What did you say ? How many ? __eou__
 15 people . __eou__  Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ? __eou__
 Of course we do ! My father's parents , Mum , Dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me . __eou__  But you don't live at home anymore . __eou__
 But you don't live at home anymore . __eou__  Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home . __eou__
 Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home . __eou__  My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house . __eou__
 My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house . __eou__  Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis __eou__
 Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis __eou__  Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent ! __eou__

 My aunts and uncles are all teachers . __eou__  You are so lucky ! __eou__
 You are so lucky ! __eou__  I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year . __eou__
 I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year . __eou__  That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time . __eou__
 That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time . __eou__  I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English . __eou__
 I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English . __eou__  800 books ? I'm impressed ! __eou__
 everything's great . I've just returned from my office . __eou__  your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ? __eou__
 sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area . __eou__  a virtual office ? __eou__
 yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . __eou__  what kind of services do they offer ? __eou__
 a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office . __eou__  sounds fun.what else ? __eou__
 I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor . __eou__  oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . __eou__
 oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . __eou__  you bet it ! __eou__
 Sure . We love each other and take care of each other . __eou__  In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ? __eou__
 My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions . __eou__  Is a family like yours common in South Korea ? __eou__
 No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho __eou__  My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting __eou__

 Of course there'll be a room for you ! __eou__  To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . __eou__
 To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . __eou__  Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . __eou__
 Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . __eou__  But four boys ! __eou__
 But four boys ! __eou__  It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . __eou__
 It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . __eou__  You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . __eou__
 You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . __eou__  It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? __eou__
 No , it's not far . It's near our old house . __eou__  Can I help you pack ? __eou__
I haven't danced for a long time . __eou__  Neither have I . __eou__
 Neither have I . __eou__  We must go to a dance soon , or we'll forget how to dance . __eou__
 I've been learning Japanese every evening . __eou__  Why have you been learning Japanese ? Why not English ? __eou__
 I hope to visit Japan next year . __eou__  Well , we'll both have to start learning all the new dances . __eou__
 Well , we'll both have to start learning all the new dances . __eou__  Yes , let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons . __eou__
 Yes , I did . __eou__  It was a good game , wasn't it ? __eou__
 Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . __eou__  What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . __eou__
 What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . __eou__  How did it finish ? __eou__
 It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . __eou__  Did your wife enjoy it ? __eou__
I hate to say goodbye , but it's late . __eou__  Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 . __eou__

 oh my , no internet access is killing me . __eou__  can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like . __eou__
 now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . __eou__  what does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . __eou__
 well , the term " discomgoogolation " comes from " discombobulate " and " google " . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . __eou__  that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . __eou__
 that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . __eou__  then , you're probably addicted . __eou__
 sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . __eou__  oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? __eou__
 I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . __eou__  what do you usually write about ? __eou__
 at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an __eou__  that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? __eou__
 it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . __eou__  got it . Are you still updating your blog ? __eou__
 sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like . __eou__  good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . __eou__
not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! __eou__  can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . __eou__
 can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . __eou__  yeah , that's right . If no one sends me test messages , I'll go crazy . __eou__
 yeah , that's right . If no one sends me test messages , I'll go crazy . __eou__  actually , this is a kind of addiction called " infomania " or " information overload " . __eou__
 actually , this is a kind of addiction called " infomania " or " information overload " . __eou__  addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! __eou__
 addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! __eou__  yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ? __eou__
 absolutely . __eou__  do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? __eou__
 yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . __eou__  do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? __eou__
 yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . __eou__  now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information . __eou__
 No , they have a big new fancy house . __eou__  Does Jim make a lot of money ? __eou__
 Yes , he does . He is a science fiction writer . __eou__  Does Jim need to make more money ? __eou__
 Afraid so . The more the better . __eou__  What do they need all that money for ? __eou__
 Well , they spend it pretty quick . New clothes , new computers and new cars every year . And they ’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress , she likes to spend a lot of money . __eou__  Do they have any children ? __eou__
 No . They want children but no luck yet . __eou__  What does Jim like to do ? __eou__
 Jim likes to travel around the world.That ' s expensive ! So he tries to make a lot of money . __eou__  What does Mona like to do ? __eou__
 Oh , she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses , and she has quite a bit of jewelry . __eou__  Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife . __eou__
 Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife . __eou__  I guess so . She is also interested in politics . She knows everyone in city government . __eou__
 I guess so . She is also interested in politics . She knows everyone in city government . __eou__  Politics can be an expensive hobby . __eou__
 Politics can be an expensive hobby . __eou__  She is pretty serious about it . Her uncle is a mayor . She wants to follow in his footsteps . __eou__
 She is pretty serious about it . Her uncle is a mayor . She wants to follow in his footsteps . __eou__  Politics is a hard game to play . __eou__
 Politics is a hard game to play . __eou__  She might do well . Everyone seems to like her . __eou__
 Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . __eou__  did you have a fight with Jack ? __eou__
 come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . __eou__  you know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . __eou__
 you know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . __eou__  is that your phone ? __eou__
 oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . __eou__  wow ! good timing . __eou__
 wow ! good timing . __eou__  he asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? __eou__
 I didn't like it . Not a bit . I couldn't stand the music . Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep . __eou__  I noticed that , it was not exciting as I expected , but the music was great . I'm always found Jazz . And that movie had a lot of Jazz . __eou__
 I noticed that , it was not exciting as I expected , but the music was great . I'm always found Jazz . And that movie had a lot of Jazz . __eou__  I know . However , Jazz always annoys me . I really don't enjoy music in a movie . __eou__
 I know . However , Jazz always annoys me . I really don't enjoy music in a movie . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that.What kind of movie do you like ? __eou__
 Anything with a lot of action , I like thrillers and chillers . __eou__  Oh , I see . __eou__

 Well , I enjoy the popcorn and being with you.You ' re more important than the movie . __eou__  Thanks for the sweet words . __eou__
 Thanks for the sweet words . __eou__  Any time . __eou__
 It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George . __eou__  Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . __eou__
 Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . __eou__  When's he coming ? __eou__
 He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth . __eou__  Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? __eou__
 No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . __eou__  Mother , I don't remember the girls . How old are they ? __eou__
 Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen . __eou__  Are they going to stay here with us ? __eou__
 Of course . The girls can stay in your room with you . __eou__  Mother , may we have a party ? __eou__
I'm glad we live in a small town . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . __eou__  Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ? __eou__
 Yes , I played with Tony and John . __eou__  What did you do after you'd played football ? __eou__
 We all went swimming . __eou__  Are you going swimming again this afternoon ? __eou__
 No , we aren't . We're going to help Mr Smith to plant some flowers . __eou__  Are you helping him all afternoon ? __eou__
 Yes , we are . We can neither play football nor do our homework today . __eou__  You're , going to be very busy . __eou__
 You're , going to be very busy . __eou__  Yes , we certainly are . But Mr Smith is going to pay us for all the work we'll do . __eou__
If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . __eou__  Would you ? I wouldn't . __eou__
 Would you ? I wouldn't . __eou__  What would you do ? __eou__
 Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . __eou__  One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . __eou__
 One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . __eou__  Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? __eou__
 As I said , I'd go round the world . __eou__  What would you do after that ? __eou__
 Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . __eou__  It doesn't sound very exciting . __eou__
 It doesn't sound very exciting . __eou__  Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? __eou__
 I'd be happy if I got a rise . __eou__  And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . __eou__
 And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . __eou__  Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . __eou__
 Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . __eou__  What'll you have ? __eou__
 I'll have a pint of the best . __eou__  I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it . __eou__
 I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it . __eou__  All right . Make it a double , will you ? __eou__
 I'm going to stay in the city . __eou__  What will you do all day ? __eou__
 I'm going to work with my father at the store . In the evening , I'll read books.On weekends , I'll go to the beach with my family . __eou__  Have you ever worked ? __eou__
 I'm going to camp . I've gone to camp for four summers . __eou__  I've never gone to camp . What do you do there ? __eou__
 We do many things . In the morning , we go swimming and boating . In the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . We sit around a camp fire at night.We sing or tell stories . __eou__  That sounds wonderful . __eou__
 That sounds wonderful . __eou__  It is wonderful . What's John going to do this summer ? __eou__
 I think he's going to the mountains with his parents . __eou__  Well , so long , Mary . Have fun . __eou__
 Well , so long , Mary . Have fun . __eou__  You too , Peter . Give my regards to John . I'll see you in September . __eou__
 Yes , I am . __eou__  What are you going to do ? __eou__
 I'm going to be a clerk . __eou__  What does a clerk do ? __eou__
 He works in an office . He writes letters and reports , and he types . __eou__  I want to be a vet . __eou__
 I want to be a vet . __eou__  A-what ? __eou__
 A vet-a veterinary surgeon . __eou__  Good gracious ! What's that ? __eou__
 A vet's a man who takes care of sick animals . He's an animal doctor . __eou__  I once read a story about a person who talked to animals . It was very interesting . __eou__
 Kobe Bryant , of course . __eou__  Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__
 Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__  He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__
 He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__  Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ? __eou__
 indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . __eou__  Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? __eou__

 Well ... this one costs more , but it has a much better sound.This part of it is made of wood , not plastic . And there's a tone control , too . __eou__  I only want it for the kitchen . I like to listen to the news at breakfast time . __eou__
 I only want it for the kitchen . I like to listen to the news at breakfast time . __eou__  Hmm ... well , the other one is good for the money . It's much cheaper . We sell clot of them and all our customers are satisfied with them . __eou__
 Hmm ... well , the other one is good for the money . It's much cheaper . We sell clot of them and all our customers are satisfied with them . __eou__  Hmm ... I'd like the cheaper one , please . Can I pay hy cheque ? __eou__
 Fine , thanks . How's your boy , Jack ? __eou__  He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish __eou__

Hi , Fanny . __eou__  Hi , Andy . __eou__
 Hi , Andy . __eou__  Are you feeling OK ? You sound a little tired this morning . __eou__
 I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood . __eou__  Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ? __eou__
 My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help . __eou__  You have got a great mother . __eou__
 You have got a great mother . __eou__  I felt embarrased . After all , I am 18 years old . Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk . __eou__

 Yeah , but i was afraid to fall back asleep . I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan . __eou__  Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will . __eou__
 He appeals to the fans thanks to two things __eou__  you mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . __eou__
 Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k __eou__  In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . __eou__
 In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . __eou__  yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes .

 Avril Lavigen ! __eou__  the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? __eou__
 yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... __eou__  so you're a big fan , eh ? __eou__

 not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . __eou__  and she was in a movie once again , right ? __eou__
 yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . __eou__  what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? __eou__
 she looked sweeter than her pictures . __eou__  did you take a photo with her ? __eou__
 no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . __eou__  crazy ! __eou__
Good evening , John . __eou__  Good evening , Mary . __eou__
 Good evening , Mary . __eou__  How are you doing ? __eou__
 Nothing special . __eou__  I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ? __eou__
 All right.Gotta go , bye , keep in touch . __eou__  Have a great day , take care , bye . __eou__
 nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . __eou__  yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . __eou__
 alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . __eou__  oh , what is it ? __eou__
 it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . __eou__  oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . __eou__
 oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . __eou__  yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . __eou__
 yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . __eou__  I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . __eou__
 yeah , almost . But there is one thing . __eou__  what ? __eou__
 I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... __eou__  what is it ? __eou__
 some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . __eou__  that makes you feel uncomfortable ? __eou__
 yeah . we never do that in a public office . __eou__  perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . __eou__
 perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . __eou__  i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . __eou__
 i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . __eou__  well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . __eou__
 well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . __eou__  just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? __eou__
 yeah . __eou__  Oh , I'm shocked . __eou__
 not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . __eou__  why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . __eou__
 well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . __eou__  it sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . __eou__
 it sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . __eou__  I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . __eou__
 I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . __eou__  really ? that's interesting ! __eou__
 sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . __eou__  as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? __eou__
 to begin with , I have to use chopsticks . __eou__  but you look quite proficient in using them now . __eou__
 but you look quite proficient in using them now . __eou__  certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch __eou__

Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch __eou__  yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i __eou__
 maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . __eou__  oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . __eou__
I heard that ben is forming his own band . __eou__  it will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . __eou__

 I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__  classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__

 I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power . __eou__  you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__

 I like wild animals . I don ’ t like spiders and snakes . I think spiders and snakes are disgusting . __eou__  I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs . __eou__

 I agree . I ’ m carry about mice . I think they ’ re so cute ! __eou__  really ? I don ’ t see the attraction . I ’ m afraid of mice . __eou__
 not really . Sometimes , I even let other people make key decision for me . __eou__  what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ? __eou__
 there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to . I can never seem to choose . I let my parents make big decisions for me . They chose my university and my course . I ended up studying something __eou__  your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! Why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? Start with some basic ones . When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak __eou__

 really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . __eou__  they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . __eou__
 they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . __eou__  dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? __eou__
 he said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . __eou__  I had some good financial news yesterday too . __eou__
 I had some good financial news yesterday too . __eou__  really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? __eou__
 no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . __eou__  It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ? __eou__
 I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . __eou__  He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? __eou__
 He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi __eou__  Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? __eou__
 The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . __eou__  How are they at swimming ? __eou__
 They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . __eou__  Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . __eou__

 I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . __eou__  It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further . __eou__
 well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . __eou__  what do you have for breakfast ? __eou__
 I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . __eou__  that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? __eou__

I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . __eou__  Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . __eou__
 Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . __eou__  Is that type of plant found in this country ? __eou__
 No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . __eou__  So would i . what other unusual plants did they show ? __eou__
 They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect molle __eou__  That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . __eou__

 That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . __eou__  I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . __eou__
 I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti .

 According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . __eou__  That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . __eou__
 Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . __eou__  Do many people like tennis ? __eou__
 More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . __eou__  In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . __eou__

 I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . __eou__  I think you ’ re right .

 I guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . __eou__  The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable . __eou__
 It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . __eou__  What methods do you use to conserve water ? __eou__
 Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . __eou__  I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__

 I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__  Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . __eou__
 Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . __eou__  What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__
 We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__  That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__

 Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . __eou__  Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . __eou__

When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . __eou__  What do the Romans do ? __eou__

 What a pity . I believe it's a very good film . __eou__  Do you go to the cinema a lot ? __eou__
 Once a week . Most nights I sit at home and watch telly __eou__  Do you know what's on tonight by any chance ? __eou__
 No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home . __eou__  Oh , I see . By the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ? __eou__

 I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know . __eou__  How many did you use to take ? __eou__
 Three every night . __eou__  Good heavens . Why did you take so many ? __eou__
 Because I was under a terrible strain . The doctor saidthey weren't very strong . Anyway , I used to feel awful the next morning . __eou__  I'm sure you did . __eou__
 I'm sure you did . __eou__  The doctor said I had to be careful . __eou__
 The doctor said I had to be careful . __eou__  He was quite right . __eou__

 There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are . __eou__  Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early . That's the kind of guy I want to meet . Let's go ! __eou__
 America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 . __eou__  In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ? __eou__
 That's easy . It was invented by Edison . __eou__  Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ? __eou__
 I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century . __eou__  Ask me a question now . __eou__
 Yes , isn't it . __eou__  Do you now the temperature today ? __eou__
 It's beautiful 75 degrees . __eou__  How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . __eou__
 How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . __eou__  Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . __eou__
 Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . __eou__  What a nuisance !

 To Australia . I'm going to visit my uncle in Brisbane for three weeks . __eou__  Good gracious ! You certainly are lucky . How are you going there ? __eou__
 By air , of course . It takes over two weeks to go by sea . __eou__  I once went to Singapore by air . It was very exciting-but never again . __eou__
 I once went to Singapore by air . It was very exciting-but never again . __eou__  Why ? Did you feel frightened ? __eou__

We've got a new manager in our department . __eou__  Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? __eou__
 Yes , I did . __eou__  I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ? __eou__
 Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too __eou__  Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? __eou__
 Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! __eou__  You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? __eou__
 Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . __eou__  What sort of clothes does he wear ? __eou__
 Perhaps that had something to do with it . __eou__  You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? __eou__
 Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing ! __eou__  Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company . __eou__
I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows . __eou__  I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life . __eou__
 sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . __eou__  I've never thought about it like that before . __eou__
 I've never thought about it like that before . __eou__  I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . __eou__
 I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . __eou__  do you think that there's life on other planets ? __eou__
 I think there must be . __eou__  why is that ? __eou__
 I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . __eou__  do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? __eou__
 no , but we're trying to contact them . __eou__  I suppose you're right . __eou__
 I suppose you're right . __eou__  I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . __eou__

 Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox . __eou__  Yeah , I ’ m with you on that . __eou__
 I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__  do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__
 it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__  like what ? __eou__
 well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__  what else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__
 if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__  how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__
 yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__  what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? __eou__
 I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__  I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__
 I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__  to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__

 Ah yes . The one who offered you a job in Australia . __eou__  That ’ s right . __eou__
 That ’ s right . __eou__  Who ’ s this ? __eou__
 Guess ! __eou__  It ’ s not you , is it ? __eou__
 That ’ s right . I grew a beard during the trip , but I shaved it off when I came home . __eou__  Why did you shave it off ? __eou__
Hello , Ken . __eou__  Hello , George . __eou__
 Hello , George . __eou__  Have you just been to the cinema ? __eou__

 Paris in the Spring . __eou__  Oh , I ’ Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good . __eou__
 Oh , I ’ Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good . __eou__  Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ? __eou__
 Yes , I have . I was there in April . __eou__  Paris in the spring , eh ? __eou__
 It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time . __eou__  Just like dear old London ! __eou__
 That must be Conrad Reeves . __eou__  Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ? __eou__
 No , He must be her fourth or fifth . __eou__  Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old ! __eou__
 Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old ! __eou__  She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty . __eou__
 She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty . __eou__  I ’ m sure she is . __eou__
 I ’ m sure she is . __eou__  She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl . __eou__
 She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl . __eou__  That was a long time ago , wasn ’ t it ? __eou__
 I like the colour very much . It's a lovely dress , but it's too small for me . __eou__  What about this one ? It's a lovely dress . It's very smart . Short skirts are in fashion now . Would you like to try it ? __eou__
 I come from England . __eou__  What's the climate like in your country ? __eou__
 It's mild , but it's not always pleasant.The weather's often cold in the North and windy in the East . It's often wet in the West and sometimes warm in the South . __eou__  Which seasons do you like best ? __eou__
 Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . __eou__  What ? You've got to be kidding me ! __eou__
 What ? You've got to be kidding me ! __eou__  I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . __eou__
 I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . __eou__  Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . __eou__
 Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . __eou__  Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . __eou__
 Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . __eou__  I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ? __eou__
 Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring __eou__  I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . __eou__
 I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . __eou__  That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters . __eou__
 Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . __eou__  Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? __eou__
 We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . __eou__  I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ? __eou__
 Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want . __eou__  It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . __eou__
 It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . __eou__  Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days . __eou__
 I come from Greece . __eou__  What's the climate like in your country ? __eou__

 I bought it here three days ago . __eou__  Ah yes , I remember now . __eou__
 Ah yes , I remember now . __eou__  Have your mechanics finished yet ? __eou__
 Well , it was my car . __eou__  Didn't you have a crash ? __eou__
 We may go abroad . I ’ m not sure . My wife wants to go to Egypt . I ’ d like to go there , too . We can ’ t make up our minds . __eou__  Will you travel by sea or by air ? __eou__
 We may travel by sea . __eou__  It ’ s cheaper , isn ’ t it ? __eou__
 It may be cheaper , but it takes a long time . __eou__  I ’ m sure you will enjoy yourselves . __eou__
 I ’ m sure you will enjoy yourselves . __eou__  Don ’ t be so sure . We may not go anywhere . My wife always worries too much . Who ’ s going to look after the dog ? Who ’ s going to look after the house ? Who ’ s going to look after the garden ? We have t __eou__
I left a suitcase on the train to London the other day . __eou__  Can you describe it , sir ? __eou__
 It's a small blue case and it's got a zip . There's a label on the handle with my name and address on it . __eou__  Is this case yours ? __eou__
 No , that's not mine . __eou__  What about this one ? This one's got a label . __eou__
 David Hall , 83 , Bridge Street . __eou__  That's right . D.N.Hall . 83.Bridge Street . Three pound and fifty pence please . __eou__

 He's a very nice person . We will all miss him . __eou__  When will the new people move into this house ? __eou__
 I think that they will move in the day after tomorrow . __eou__  Will you see Mien today , Janey ? __eou__
 Please give him my regards . Poor Mien ! He didn't want to leave this house . __eou__  No , he didn't want to leave , but his wife did ! __eou__
 I'm afraid it's empty . __eou__  What a pity ! __eou__
 What a pity ! __eou__  It doesn't matter . __eou__
 It doesn't matter . __eou__  Have a biscuit instead . Eat more and smoke less ! __eou__
 I ’ m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ’ s terribly dry . __eou__  What a nuisance ! __eou__
 What a nuisance ! __eou__  Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day . __eou__
 Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day . __eou__  Well , I ’ ll have tea by myself . That was quick ! Have you finished already ? __eou__
 Yes , Look out of the window . __eou__  It ’ s raining . That means you needn ’ t water the garden . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ Ve nearly finished , June . I ’ m sure we will win something this week . __eou__  You always say that , but we never win anything ! What will you do if you win a lot of money ? __eou__
 If I win a lot of money , I shall buy you a mink coat . __eou__  I don ’ t want a mink coat ! I want to see the world . __eou__
 I don ’ t want a mink coat ! I want to see the world . __eou__  All right . If we win a lot of money , we shall travel around the world and we shall stay at the best hotels . Then we will return home and buy a big house in the country . We will have a beautiful __eou__
 All right . If we win a lot of money , we shall travel around the world and we shall stay at the best hotels . Then we will return home and buy a big house in the country . We will have a beautiful __eou__  But if we spend all that money we shall be poor again . What will we do then ? __eou__
 If we spend all the money , we will try and win the football pools again . __eou__  It ’ s a pleasant dream , but everything depends on if ! __eou__

 But mine equals yours in economy . __eou__  That's true . __eou__
I hear Fred is a very good student in your class . __eou__  Though he's not the one who can get the highest score , yet , on the whole , he is comparable to the best . __eou__
 Though he's not the one who can get the highest score , yet , on the whole , he is comparable to the best . __eou__  What do you mean by on the whole . __eou__
 In comparison to city life , the country life is quiet and peaceful . __eou__  But it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city . __eou__
 But it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city . __eou__  Yeah , I agree.Every wall has two sides . __eou__
 Charles Dickens.Actually no one can parallel him in writing . __eou__  I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that . I like D.H.Laurence ' s novels better . __eou__
 I don't think so.It ' s impossible to equate wealth and happiness . __eou__  Could I understand what you said as the poorest is the happiest ? __eou__
 I'm not very sure.but I know ruby is less valuable than diamond . __eou__  How do you know that ? __eou__

This is a precious opportunity for us and our company . __eou__  You are right . We ’ re hoping that this is a long-term opportunity , and just a flash in the pan . __eou__

You have always got your nose in the air , which hurts many boys ’ hearts . __eou__  I am afraid not . I have no interest in them at all . __eou__
Look over there . That is what I am looking for . Let's go ! __eou__  I want to see you play . Be quick ! __eou__
I ’ m so surprised to meet you in this remote village . Long time no see . __eou__  Yeah . How are you these days ? __eou__
How time flies ! We have been lovers for nearly a year . We hit it off instantly . __eou__  Yes , but do you think there is eternal love in the world ? __eou__
The bracelet is so well suited to you . It looks very nice . __eou__  Yeah , I cherish it . Because I have been working like a dog for two months to buy it . __eou__
 There ’ s a typhoon coming . __eou__  No way ! __eou__
 No way ! __eou__  Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . __eou__
We are doing Secret Santa at the office again this year . __eou__  Whose name did you pick ? __eou__
 Booze ! __eou__  Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . __eou__
Sorry . The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired . __eou__  Knock on wood . But I have a very important date . __eou__
 No , what ? __eou__  She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer . __eou__
 She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer . __eou__  Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating ! __eou__
 Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating ! __eou__  No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office . __eou__
 Really ? I think you ’ ll love it . __eou__  As long as I don ’ t have to row . __eou__
 It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . __eou__  Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ? __eou__
 Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend . __eou__  I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something . __eou__
 Let me check.Oh , oh ! It ’ s at 3:25 . __eou__  Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ? __eou__
 It ’ s at ... gate 14 . __eou__  Oh , great ! That ’ s at the other end of the terminal ! __eou__
 Oh , great ! That ’ s at the other end of the terminal ! __eou__  OK , so here ’ s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 ! __eou__
 OK , so here ’ s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 ! __eou__  I ’ m be right behind ya ! __eou__

 I ’ m really lucky to do something I really love . __eou__  What station do you work at ? __eou__

 Great , thanks . __eou__  No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers ! __eou__
 I usee I would say that would be moving out of my parents ’ house for the first time . __eou__  Really ? Why is that ? __eou__
 Till I moved out of my parents ’ home , I became a lot more independent . __eou__  What would you say was the lowest point in your life ? __eou__
 That would definitely be getting a divorce . __eou__  What went wrong ? __eou__
 We just weren't right for each other . __eou__  How long were you married ? __eou__
 The marriage only lasted about a year . __eou__  Have you remarried since then ? __eou__
 Yes , I got married to a man that I met shortly after I divorced my first husband . __eou__  Do you think you'll ever get a divorce again ? __eou__
 Oh I hope not , my first marriage was a mistake , but this one isn ’ t . __eou__  How long have you been married ? __eou__
 About 15 years now . __eou__  Do you think you'll still love him when he is old and gray ? __eou__
 I think so , hopefully we ’ ll have a long and a happy life together . __eou__  I ’ m sure you will . __eou__
 I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and my parents . __eou__  I didn't know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ? __eou__
 We're identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else ! __eou__  Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ? __eou__
 We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn't mention to your biological father . __eou__  I don't know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family . __eou__
 I don't know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family . __eou__  What about your step-brother's mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ? __eou__
 No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later . __eou__  Sounds like it was ment to be . __eou__
 No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet . __eou__  you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture ! __eou__
 Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off ! __eou__  What ? How did that happen ? __eou__
 They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face . __eou__  Wow . What does his look like now ? __eou__
 It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too . __eou__  What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ? __eou__
 He was actually quite handsome . What a shame . __eou__  What's he going to do now ? __eou__
 I was born in London , but I spent most of my childhood in Hongkong . __eou__  What was your childhood like ? __eou__
 I had a pretty strict up-bring , and my parents and I were always fighting about it . __eou__  Do you get along with your parents now ? __eou__
 Oh , sure . Once they reached middle age , they became a lot less uptight . __eou__  Where did you go to university ? __eou__
 My parents wanted me to stay in Hongkong , but I decided to go back to England , I graduated from Oxford University with a degree in English literature . __eou__  What ’ s your current occupation ? __eou__
 I ’ m a freelance writer . i write magazine articles and fiction books __eou__  Did you always know you wanted to be a writer ? __eou__
 No , I didn ’ t . I was an english teacher for about five years , but by the time I was thirty , I decided I want a fresh challenge . __eou__  How did you start writing ? __eou__
 I started writing margin articles for fun , and eventually was asked to write a book , so I was pretty lucky . __eou__  Are you writing a book now ? __eou__
 Yes , it ’ s about a group of friends living in a foreign country , and all the strange experiences they have __eou__  Sounds interesting . __eou__
 My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl __eou__  Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__
 For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . __eou__  Don't you think you would miss having other people around ? __eou__
 No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy __eou__  If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? __eou__
 That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like __eou__  Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? __eou__
 No ... __eou__  Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hotpot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ? __eou__
 That's it ! That's the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! __eou__  You really have a bid head , don't you ! __eou__
 Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . __eou__  How tall is she ? __eou__
 She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . __eou__  Is she chubby ? __eou__
 Not at all . She's actually very athletic . __eou__  It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? __eou__
 No , but she does wear contact lenses . __eou__  How's her skin ? __eou__
 She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . __eou__  Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? __eou__
 I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos __eou__  What's the tattoo on her foot like ? __eou__
 It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one . __eou__  Even her mom ? __eou__
 Yes , even her mom . __eou__  What's her personality like ? __eou__
 She's a lot like me . __eou__  So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! __eou__
 I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . __eou__  Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . __eou__
 Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . __eou__  Don't you think it's too bloody ? __eou__
 Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite . __eou__  What kind of magazine is it ? __eou__
 It's instructive and inspiring . __eou__  Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ? __eou__
 No , it's a semimonthly . __eou__  Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? __eou__
 Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . __eou__  Oh , I think I should try to read one . __eou__
Hey , Mark , long time no see . __eou__  Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? __eou__
 Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . __eou__  Really ? How was it ? __eou__
 Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . __eou__  I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . __eou__
 I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . __eou__  They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . __eou__
 They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . __eou__  I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? __eou__
 Not much . I've go enough city life in Beijing . __eou__  I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . __eou__
 I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . __eou__  Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? __eou__
 Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . __eou__  What have you been doing ? __eou__
 I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . __eou__  Really ? Good luck for them . __eou__
 Really ? Good luck for them . __eou__  Thanks . And how are your parents ? __eou__
 They're both very well , thanks . __eou__  Where are you going now ? __eou__
 I can't . I have to meet someone . __eou__  It's been nice talking to you . __eou__
 It's been nice talking to you . __eou__  Good-bye . See you again sometime . __eou__
 Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . __eou__  What ? __eou__
 His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . __eou__  Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . __eou__
 Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . __eou__  Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things . __eou__
OK . Everything is in the bag . __eou__  Excellent ! Let ’ s set off . __eou__
 I'm very glad to hear that . __eou__  Come here , let me introduce some friends to you . __eou__
After this lunch , I haven ’ t got much green left . __eou__  Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out . __eou__
I can drink ten cups in fifteen minutes . I ’ m sure . __eou__  You ? You are full of hot air . __eou__
 Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . __eou__  Any rain ? __eou__
 No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . __eou__  I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . __eou__
Happy Mother ’ s Day , Mom ! __eou__  Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn ’ t have ! __eou__
 Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn ’ t have ! __eou__  Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . __eou__
 Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . __eou__  I forgot what I put up with in that case . I do deserve these flowers . __eou__
 Oh , I forgot . __eou__  Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . __eou__
 Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . __eou__  I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . __eou__
 Probably nothing . __eou__  You have to do something romantic . __eou__
 Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! __eou__  Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . __eou__
 I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . __eou__  you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? __eou__
 I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! __eou__  doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? __eou__
 well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . __eou__  did you play a lot of games when you were little ? __eou__
 my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . __eou__  do you still like playing those games ? __eou__
 everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . __eou__  some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? __eou__
 no , I prefer to play with people I know . __eou__  how about mah-jong ? __eou__
 it's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . __eou__  I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! __eou__
 I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! __eou__  I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! __eou__
 to be honest , I don't really care for either one . __eou__  I thought everyone liked basketball . Why don't you like it ? __eou__
 I used to play basketball when I was little , and I never scored a goal . Every time I watch a basketball game , I think about how horrible I was at it . __eou__  that makes sense . __eou__
 that makes sense . __eou__  how about you ? What's your favorite sport of all time ? __eou__
 my absolute favorite is ice hockey . __eou__  have you ever seen a live game ? __eou__
 sure , many times . It's an exciting game for spectators to watch . __eou__  I've never really understood the game . __eou__
 I've never really understood the game . __eou__  it's not that difficult . If you want to watch a game with me , I can explain the rules and the tactics while we're watching . __eou__
 not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so I can explain the game to you . __eou__  that's a good idea . __eou__
 that's a good idea . __eou__  let's watch the Canadian team . They have a good manager and a great coach . __eou__
 I just stayed at home and watched TV . __eou__  did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? __eou__
 yes , it was a very evenly matched game . __eou__  what were the results of the game ? __eou__
 it ended in a tie . __eou__  what was the actual score ? __eou__
 it was three all . __eou__  really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . __eou__
 really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . __eou__  if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . __eou__
 if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . __eou__  what happened ? __eou__
 their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . __eou__  that explains it . __eou__
 that explains it . __eou__  how many more games are left this season ? __eou__
 that was the last game before the playoffs . __eou__  when do the playoffs start ? __eou__
 of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . __eou__  Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . __eou__
Congratulations on the new house ! __eou__  Thanks ! We love it . __eou__
 Thanks ! We love it . __eou__  Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful . __eou__
 Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful . __eou__  I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it ! __eou__
 it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . __eou__  terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life . __eou__
 apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity . __eou__  she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young . __eou__
 she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young . __eou__  I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world . __eou__

 you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa . __eou__  did they mention that in the article ? __eou__
 yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary . __eou__  that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has . __eou__
 that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has . __eou__  I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels . __eou__
 I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels . __eou__  it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room ! __eou__
 it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room ! __eou__  what a waste . It's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols . __eou__
 no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . __eou__  yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . __eou__

 I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . __eou__  did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? __eou__
 I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . __eou__  Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? __eou__
 yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . __eou__  I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . __eou__
 I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . __eou__  people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . __eou__
 people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . __eou__  I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . __eou__
 I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . __eou__  that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . __eou__
 that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . __eou__  thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! __eou__
 thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! __eou__  being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . __eou__
the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! __eou__  exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . __eou__
 exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . __eou__  on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . __eou__
 on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . __eou__  as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . __eou__
 as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . __eou__  I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse __eou__
 I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse __eou__  what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? __eou__
 it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . __eou__  I see , so it's similar to global warming ? __eou__
 they're related to one another , yes . __eou__  I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . __eou__
 I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . __eou__  people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . __eou__
 people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . __eou__  people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . __eou__
 people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . __eou__  I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . __eou__
 I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions . __eou__  homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ? __eou__
 I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat . I figure that if they're homeless , they're probably hungry . __eou__  that's a good idea . Do they usually accept the food ? __eou__
 almost always . However , sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash . __eou__  it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now . __eou__
 it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now . __eou__  the cost of living in London is just too high for most people . __eou__
 the cost of living in London is just too high for most people . __eou__  it's true . The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment . __eou__
 it's true . The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment . __eou__  did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ? __eou__
 there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . If only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble . __eou__  added to that is the high unemployment rate right now . __eou__
 added to that is the high unemployment rate right now . __eou__  something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon . __eou__
 something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon . __eou__  politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class . __eou__

 didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . __eou__  how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! __eou__
 if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . __eou__  what ? What kind of drugs was he using ? __eou__
 he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . __eou__  I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . __eou__
 I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . __eou__  they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__
 they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__  that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__
 that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__  I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! __eou__
 I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! __eou__  regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . __eou__

 I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . __eou__  let's hope so . __eou__
 there's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes . __eou__  which one is that ? __eou__
 I've seen the British version and loved it , but have never seen the American version . __eou__  it's almost exactly the same . I think it's a hilarious show . __eou__
 it's almost exactly the same . I think it's a hilarious show . __eou__  what are you watching now ? __eou__
 they're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now . __eou__  I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated . __eou__
 I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated . __eou__  I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__
 I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__  have you got satellite , cable , or digital TV ? __eou__
 we have digital TV . It's amazing though---even with 100 channels , there's often nothing on that I'd want to watch ! __eou__  do you watch a lot of TV then ? __eou__
 I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . __eou__  do you know anyone in the play ? __eou__
 actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . __eou__  really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? __eou__
 that's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . __eou__  so you've seen other plays that he's directed ? __eou__
 I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . __eou__  what did you do ? __eou__
 I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much . __eou__  why not ? __eou__
 I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . __eou__  that sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . __eou__
 yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . __eou__  do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? __eou__
 I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__  no , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . __eou__
 no , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . __eou__  where are you from ? __eou__
 I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . __eou__  did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? __eou__
 most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . __eou__  wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__
 wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__  actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . __eou__
 actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . __eou__  have you ever experiences a flood ? __eou__
 no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! __eou__  that sure didn't last long ! __eou__
 why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . __eou__  well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . __eou__
 well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . __eou__  do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? __eou__
 no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . __eou__  it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . __eou__
 it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . __eou__  religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . __eou__
 religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . __eou__  what do you think about abortion ? __eou__
 I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . __eou__  do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? __eou__
 I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . __eou__  why not ? It's their children , too . __eou__
 that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . __eou__  that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . __eou__
Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! __eou__  What's that ? __eou__
 That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nice . __eou__  Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! __eou__
 Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! __eou__  Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . __eou__
 Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . __eou__  I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . __eou__
 I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . __eou__  That sounds crazy . They can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__
 That sounds crazy . They can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__  Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . __eou__
 Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . __eou__  I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . __eou__
 I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . __eou__  We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . __eou__
 We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . __eou__  Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? __eou__
 I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . __eou__  Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? __eou__
 I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on Earth . __eou__  You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! __eou__
 You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! __eou__  Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . __eou__
 while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . __eou__  why not ? __eou__
 the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! __eou__  it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . __eou__
 it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . __eou__  I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . __eou__
 I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . __eou__  I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . __eou__
 I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . __eou__  all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . __eou__
 all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . __eou__  perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . __eou__
 perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . __eou__  I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . __eou__
 I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . __eou__  that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . __eou__
 that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . __eou__  you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . __eou__
 I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table . __eou__  you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish . __eou__
 you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish . __eou__  who's the director ? __eou__
 no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile . __eou__  how much does the magadize cost ? __eou__
 it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon . __eou__  that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ? __eou__
 Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . __eou__  I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine ! __eou__
 yes . __eou__  well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him . __eou__
 she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back . __eou__  wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ? __eou__
 it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . __eou__  are you looking forward to doing more editing work ? __eou__
 yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! __eou__  do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ? __eou__
 I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you . __eou__  I'm really looking forward to reading your column . __eou__
 I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . __eou__  do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? __eou__
 it's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . __eou__  what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__
 it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain . __eou__  that doesn't sound pretty . __eou__
 that doesn't sound pretty . __eou__  do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__
 well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends . __eou__  you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . __eou__
 you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . __eou__  I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__
 I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . __eou__  if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! __eou__
 if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! __eou__  if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . __eou__
 to be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . __eou__  what do you have in mind ? __eou__
 I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . __eou__  isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? __eou__
 Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . __eou__  that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? __eou__
 it's on at 8: 00 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . __eou__  great . Shall I meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ? __eou__
 yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . __eou__  that's the Return of the King , right ? __eou__
 I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . __eou__  did you read the books before you watched the movies ? __eou__
 yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . __eou__  yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . __eou__
 yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . __eou__  I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . __eou__
 I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . __eou__  most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . __eou__
 most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . __eou__  that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . __eou__
 that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . __eou__  I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . __eou__
 I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . __eou__  actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! __eou__
 I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . __eou__  you do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . __eou__
 well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! __eou__  well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . __eou__
 I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__  maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__
 good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__  if I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__
 No , sir . __eou__  Let's call it a day then.Good - bye , everyone . __eou__
 Let's call it a day then.Good - bye , everyone . __eou__  Good-bye , sir __eou__
 Both are superb in their skills.Anyhow , Fred is one up on Bill from my point of view . __eou__  You said it . __eou__

We are through . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . __eou__  I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her . __eou__

I need to go to the bank . __eou__  But they are closed today . __eou__

 No . We broke up last month . I ’ m taking a break from dating for a while . __eou__  Did you break up amicably ? Sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up . __eou__
 Yes , I am . We ’ re thinking about getting engaged . We ’ Ve been dating for over a year now . __eou__  Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ? __eou__
 I havn't seen her for a while.She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her.He was seeing a girl form his office.One day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . __eou__  She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon . __eou__
 She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon . __eou__  Really ? They ’ Ve been together for a long time . When are they getting married ? __eou__
 I think it ’ s 26th September . I ’ ll check and make sure that Tina remembers to invite you to the hen night . __eou__  Thanks . Hey , look at that guy over there . I think he fancies you . __eou__
 Thanks . Hey , look at that guy over there . I think he fancies you . __eou__  He certainly looks interested , doesn ’ t he ? Shall we invite him over to our table ? __eou__
 Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . __eou__  Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . __eou__
 Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress . __eou__  When will that be ready ? __eou__
 The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks . __eou__  You ’ re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ’ Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything . __eou__
 You ’ re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ’ Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything . __eou__  Yes . We ’ Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious . __eou__
 Yes . We ’ Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious . __eou__  Which hotel will the reception be held at ? __eou__
 The palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job . __eou__  Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__
 Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__  Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people . __eou__
 Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people . __eou__  I think you make the right decision . __eou__
 I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters . __eou__  How long have you been married ? __eou__
 If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce . __eou__  If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! __eou__
 If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! __eou__  ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . __eou__
 ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . __eou__  Of course not ! __eou__
 He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . __eou__  Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? __eou__
 I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . __eou__  We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls-probably because I ’ m so tall myself . __eou__
 We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls-probably because I ’ m so tall myself . __eou__  Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? __eou__
 Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . __eou__  I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . __eou__
 Cindy ’ s husband is Ron . __eou__  How many children do Cindy and Ron have ? __eou__

 He's 21 . How old is James ? __eou__  He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . __eou__
 He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . __eou__  How's your father ? __eou__
 He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . __eou__  He can spend more time with his grandchildren . __eou__
 He can spend more time with his grandchildren . __eou__  Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . __eou__
 Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . __eou__  So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! __eou__
 So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! __eou__  How do you want to spend your old age ? __eou__
 About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__  I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__
 I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__  Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__
 Oh , he's fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__  He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__
 I had mine when I was 24 . That's a little young . I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__  Yes , I think you're right . I'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__
 Yes , I think you're right . I'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__  Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country ? __eou__
 Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life.Parents usually try to discour __eou__  Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__
 Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__  It's almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . __eou__  what did you argue about ? __eou__
 he borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . __eou__  well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . __eou__
 well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . __eou__  yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . __eou__
 yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . __eou__  did you lend him a lot of money ? __eou__
 not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . __eou__  well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything r __eou__
 I like people who are open and friendly . Those people are usually more active and fun to be with . I like spending time with my friends . We go to bars together or play sports together . __eou__  I don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . Honesty is very important to me . __eou__
 I don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . Honesty is very important to me . __eou__  I think it ’ s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them . __eou__
 I think it ’ s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them . __eou__  you can find out from their friends . __eou__
 you can find out from their friends . __eou__  if you know any of their friends . You can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . You have to go out and make the first move sometimes . I also like funny people . __eou__
 if you know any of their friends . You can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . You have to go out and make the first move sometimes . I also like funny people . __eou__  oh , I don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . You never know when they are joking and when they are being serious . __eou__
 oh , I don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . You never know when they are joking and when they are being serious . __eou__  sometimes it can be hard to tell , but if you know the person fairly well , you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking . __eou__
 sometimes it can be hard to tell , but if you know the person fairly well , you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking . __eou__  it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . How is it that we are such good friends ? __eou__
 I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . __eou__  That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . __eou__
 That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . __eou__  That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? __eou__
 Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . __eou__  Did you ? How is he these days ? __eou__
 He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other . __eou__  I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ? __eou__
 No , not very much . He's too ambitious and dishonest . __eou__  I agree . I like his brother Paul . They are not alike . __eou__
 I agree . I like his brother Paul . They are not alike . __eou__  Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . __eou__
 Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . __eou__  What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? __eou__
 I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__  Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__
 Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__  Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first.Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! __eou__
 Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first.Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! __eou__  You're right . I love going out and making new friends . __eou__
 You're right . I love going out and making new friends . __eou__  So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? __eou__
 If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . But a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . So I think it should be OK ? __eou__  Are you taking anything ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . __eou__  That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbors don ’ t mind too much . __eou__
 That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbors don ’ t mind too much . __eou__  Helen gets on very well with her neighbors . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . __eou__

 it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__  I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__
 I doubt it , I ‘ ll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . __eou__  I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . __eou__
 I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . __eou__  afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . __eou__
 afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . __eou__  yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . __eou__
 yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . __eou__  Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious . __eou__
 Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious . __eou__  I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . __eou__
 I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . __eou__  what did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . __eou__
 very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . __eou__  that cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? __eou__
 well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! __eou__  so , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? __eou__
 yes . One bedroom is for my wife and i . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on __eou__  what ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . __eou__
 what ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . __eou__  that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . __eou__
 that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . __eou__  are the rooms nice and bright ? __eou__
 yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . __eou__  do you have a balcony ? __eou__
 no , we don ’ t . we wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . __eou__  you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? __eou__
so , your friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . __eou__  my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b __eou__
 my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b __eou__  that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? __eou__
 most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help __eou__  so , what did you get them ? __eou__
 I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . __eou__  what ’ s wrong with is ? __eou__
 she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . __eou__  household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . __eou__
 household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . __eou__  I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year __eou__
Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? __eou__  Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat __eou__
 Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat __eou__  No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? __eou__
 Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho __eou__  I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . __eou__
 I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . __eou__  I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . __eou__
 I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . __eou__  So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet . __eou__

 My name is Jeff . __eou__  What do you do ? __eou__
 I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming . __eou__  Would you like to go out some time ? __eou__
 Anywhere with you . __eou__  Aren ’ t you sweet . __eou__
 It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive . __eou__  We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . __eou__
 We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . __eou__  Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around . __eou__
 Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around . __eou__  That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . __eou__
 That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . __eou__  Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . __eou__
 Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . __eou__  So which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__
 I prefer going by train , even though it costs more . __eou__  Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? __eou__

 Sounds like I'm missing out on a good time.Oh , well , there's always next year . __eou__  I'm sure you will have fun no matter where you go.Remember to take your bag . __eou__
 To be honest , I don't really like doing either one , I can't cook and I hate cleaning . __eou__  Suppose you have to do one of the two , which do you prefer ? __eou__
 I would rather do the dishes than cook . __eou__  I prefer the absent.the way I see it , to do the dishes is boring . __eou__
 I prefer the absent.the way I see it , to do the dishes is boring . __eou__  let's make a deal . __eou__

 Not much . __eou__  This Friday , I'm throwing a party . __eou__
 This Friday , I'm throwing a party . __eou__  Oh really ? I didn't know that . __eou__
 Oh really ? I didn't know that . __eou__  Are you serious ? __eou__
 I haven't heard anything about it . __eou__  Can you make it ? __eou__
 The party starts at 8 . __eou__  Yeah , I think I'll go . __eou__
 Nothing really . __eou__  I'm throwing a party on Friday . __eou__
 I didn't realize that . __eou__  You didn't ? __eou__
 Nobody has told me anything about your party . __eou__  Did you want to go ? __eou__
 At 8 __eou__  I'll be there . __eou__
 That would be me ! __eou__  Rubin ! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before . __eou__
 Rubin ! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before . __eou__  I hope that what they had to say was mostly good ! __eou__
 I hope that what they had to say was mostly good ! __eou__  They only said wonderful things about you . You did a good job of finding me . __eou__
 They only said wonderful things about you . You did a good job of finding me . __eou__  Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard . __eou__
 Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard . __eou__  Yes , I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons ! __eou__
 Yes , I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons ! __eou__  I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe . __eou__
 It's Smith . Here is my driver's license . __eou__  Yes , I do show your reservation . How could you like to pay for the room ? __eou__
 I'd like to put it on my VISA . __eou__  Fine . Here is your room key , here is also a map of our hotel . The swimming pool , gym and sauna are all located on first floor . __eou__
 I'm not sure yet . __eou__  Well , did you want to go see a movie with me ? __eou__
 Leaving on September 5th and returning to New York City on October 9th . __eou__  Do you prefer an aisle or a window seat ? __eou__
 No , this is the first time . __eou__  Let me tell you . First you must buy a ticket . __eou__
 Something like a passport . __eou__  Can I board the plane now ? __eou__
 No , you also need a boarding pass . __eou__  Thank you . Now I know how to travel by air . __eou__
It's very kind of you to show me around . __eou__  Not at all . What would you like to see first ? __eou__
 No , it's the first time I've been here . __eou__  I will take you to Li River after walking around here . __eou__
 We offer a complementary breakfast buffet and free parking . __eou__  Good . Let me give you my credit card number to reserve a room . __eou__
 We have only one mid-size car left . __eou__  Great , what's the rate per day ? __eou__
 It's 40 $ plus tax per day on limited mileage . __eou__  I'm going to need it for three days . __eou__
 It is allowed to carry 55 pounds for each passenger . __eou__  But if I have more than 55 pounds , what can I do ? __eou__
 You will have to pay some for every extra pound . __eou__  How about my hand carry luggage ? __eou__
 I'm going to visit some relatives here for several months . __eou__  Do you have anything to declare ? Jewellery or cash ? __eou__
 The only things I brought were some cloths and my notebook computer . __eou__  Did you bring any fruits , vegetables , fresh meats or plants into this country ? __eou__
 The price for one person for a ten-day tour is only 1,099 US dollars , which includes round trip airfare . __eou__  That sounds reasonable . Let me think it over . And I'll call your back to make reservation . __eou__
Hotel front desk . __eou__  Hi , I'd like to leave a wake-up call . __eou__
 Yes , Jason , right ? Nice to meet you . Welcome to Taiwan . __eou__  Thanks , good to meet you , too . __eou__

 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy . __eou__  Oh , that's too bad . Do you get a good knowledge of China ? __eou__
 Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most . __eou__  All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World . __eou__
 All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World . __eou__  Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty . __eou__

 I heard about it , but I don't have any clothes made from silk . __eou__  Go and pick some stuff up . The price can always surprise foreign friends . __eou__
 We are going to Jingshan Park . Originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park . __eou__  Where is it ? __eou__
 It is at the north of Forbidden City , on the central axis of Beijing . __eou__  What can we see in it ? __eou__
 Jingshan consists of five individual peaks , and there lies an elaborate pavilion on the top of each peak . These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time . These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing . __eou__  Anything else ? __eou__
 According to the dictates of Eng Shut , it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill . When the capital was moved to Beijing , no hill existed at this location , so one was constructed . It is called " Coal Hill " . The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty , Chongzhen , committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644 . __eou__  Tragedy . __eou__
 Tragedy . __eou__  Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering . People can often find elder folks dancing , singing opera and other cultural activities at Jingshan Park . __eou__
Ladies and gentlemen , now we are in the National Forest Park . __eou__  What's that ? __eou__
 The stone is a prehistoric log . It was turned to stone millions of years ago . __eou__  Really ? It's unbelievable . __eou__
 But it's the truth . __eou__  Do you have Ginkgo trees here ? __eou__
 We don't have them here , I'm afraid . Ginkgo trees grow well only in cold weather . __eou__  What are these trees opposite to the pine trees ? __eou__
 They are poplar trees . They are widely used in our lives . __eou__  I think I know that . __eou__
Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring . __eou__  How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ? __eou__
 Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it . __eou__  How ignorant I am ! __eou__
 How ignorant I am ! __eou__  The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ” __eou__
 The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ” __eou__  I know that tea . It smells fragrant . __eou__

 It is beef . Do you like it ? __eou__  That's OK . Thanks very much . __eou__
 That's OK . Thanks very much . __eou__  You are welcome . Please press that button if you need any help . __eou__
 578 yuan a night , plus VAT , including air-conditioner and TV . __eou__  Does that include breakfast ? Can I make calls on outside line ? __eou__
 Yes , it includes English breakfast . For the phone , I am afraid you can not . __eou__  OK , that's fine . Could you hold it for me ? __eou__
It was nice talking to you . __eou__  Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ? __eou__
 I really have to go . __eou__  Why ? I still wanted to talk to you . __eou__

 That's harsh . __eou__  I'm sorry , but I have to go . __eou__
 2:30 __eou__  Well , the afternoon will be fine . __eou__
 I don't know . Maybe it's broken . __eou__  Can you do something about it ? __eou__
 That's better , but it's still not quite right . __eou__  Why not tell the clerk and ask them to repair it . __eou__
 I'm not quite sure yet . __eou__  How about you see a movie with me and my friend ? __eou__
 No good movies come to mind . __eou__  Have you decided whether or not you would like to go ? __eou__
 No , thanks . Maybe another time . __eou__  For sure another day . __eou__
I've enjoyed conversing with you . __eou__  Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ? __eou__

 I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer . __eou__  How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ? __eou__
 You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? __eou__  We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . __eou__
 We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . __eou__  I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? __eou__
 Yes . I find dates to be a lot of fun . __eou__  What's so fun about them ? __eou__
 They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better . __eou__  So you always have fun on dates ? __eou__
 Not always . I don't always like the person I'm on the date with . __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 My date may not be my type . __eou__  So then why would you ask them out in the first place ? __eou__
 I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type . __eou__  Sounds like a huge waste of time to me . __eou__
 Sounds like a huge waste of time to me . __eou__  Now that I think about it , it really is sometimes . __eou__
 You can't be serious ! __eou__  Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . __eou__
 Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . __eou__  After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . __eou__
 Things are going well for me , Joe . __eou__  Want to go see a movie tonight ? __eou__
 There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . __eou__  I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” __eou__

 Good luck finding the waitress ! __eou__  The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ? __eou__
 I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . __eou__  I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . __eou__
 I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . __eou__  I think that we should leave 10 % . __eou__
 I'll walk over and get the bill , since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon . __eou__  Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . __eou__
 My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip . __eou__  I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . __eou__
 I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . __eou__  Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service . __eou__
 Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service . __eou__  I agree . We will leave $ 3.60 for the tip . __eou__
 My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry . __eou__  It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us . __eou__
 It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us . __eou__  Yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight . __eou__
 Yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight . __eou__  Are your vegetables a little mushy ? __eou__
 The vegetables seem to not be very fresh . __eou__  Mine aren't so good , either . __eou__
 Mine aren't so good , either . __eou__  I usually enjoy the meals here , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal . __eou__

 Our total for dinner is $ 36.00 . __eou__  What do you think would be the right amount to tip ? __eou__
 I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received . __eou__  I agree that it was bad service , but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job . __eou__
 I agree that it was bad service , but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job . __eou__  I believe that 10 % is just about right amount . __eou__

 Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . __eou__  And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? __eou__
 That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . __eou__  It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . __eou__
 It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . __eou__  Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? __eou__
 I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel . __eou__  You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? __eou__
 I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here . __eou__  Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well . __eou__
 Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well . __eou__  Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list . __eou__
 Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list . __eou__  How many people are on the waiting list right now ? __eou__
 Just me . I'm traveling alone . __eou__  And how many bags do you have ? __eou__
 Just one carry-on and one that I want to check . __eou__  You must be going to some island to relax in the sun where all you need is a swim suit and a toothbrush . __eou__
 You must be going to some island to relax in the sun where all you need is a swim suit and a toothbrush . __eou__  That's right . __eou__

OK , Mr . Wang . Thank you very much for coming to the airport to see us off . Your great country and your hospitality have left a very deep impression on all of us and your working attitude and your way of doing business have changed my opinions about Chinese people . __eou__  Really ? I'm glad to hear that . __eou__
 That's true . And this trip has been a very productive one for us . __eou__  Thank you again for your visit . We are looking forward to your reply . __eou__

 Believe me , Mr . Wang . I'll do my best to promote the transaction . __eou__  We are happy that we have established business relations . I really hope that we'll have more business to do and more opportunities to meet each other . __eou__
 I am sorry . We are full up for tomorrow . __eou__  Well , is there any other hotel nearby ? __eou__
 Yes , the Sunset Hotel is three blocks away . Maybe you can ask them . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 I'm not sure . __eou__  Is it broken ? __eou__
 I hope not ! Oh , I see . __eou__  What is it ? __eou__
 The batteries are worn down . I need replace them . __eou__  Where can we get batteries ? __eou__
 All photography shops carry them . __eou__  OK . Let's take a walk and look for a shop that does . __eou__
 Let me see . Yes , we still have four left . __eou__  Well , I would like to book a single room . __eou__
 Excuse me , sir . This is your passport . __eou__  Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ? __eou__
 Yes . As a matter of fact , you can't board the plane without boarding pass . __eou__  Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . __eou__
 Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . __eou__  I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass . __eou__
 Ugh , in about thirty minutes , sir . __eou__  Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head , bone head , bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand . ) . __eou__
 Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head , bone head , bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand . ) . __eou__  Calm down , sir . You are creating a commotion . __eou__
 Could be . __eou__  Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back . __eou__
 Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back . __eou__  ( Benjamin starts to run and then he seems to remember something and returns . ) Ugh , excuse me , where is the Lost and Found ? __eou__
 It's down in the lobby . Turn left at exit B . __eou__  Thank you , thank you , thanks again . __eou__
 Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . __eou__  What kind of presents do you want ? __eou__
 Just a hunch , sir . __eou__  How much again ? __eou__
 $ 59.95 . __eou__  That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . __eou__
 Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . __eou__  Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . __eou__
 Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . __eou__  That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . __eou__
 It's $ 60 here . __eou__  That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ? __eou__
 Of course not , sir . __eou__  OK , I'll take one . __eou__
 Of course , it's a soft leather one , you know , not a sports one that looks childish . __eou__  Mmm ... does it zip closed ? __eou__
 No , it's straps closed , and it has a buckle in the front . __eou__  OK , can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ? __eou__
 Oh , it's a Polo . It has the logo on the back and at the bottom in the left-hand corner . __eou__  OK , can you name the items in it ? __eou__
 Well , all the gifts for my family , you know , two pairs of sneakers for my children and a bottle of perfume for my wife . __eou__  OK , sir , I'm sure it's your bag . Thank you for your cooperation . You can have it now . __eou__

Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in . __eou__  Where else haven't I been to yet ? __eou__
 Not many but these ones . They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls ! __eou__  Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections they have ? __eou__
 Well , there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city , that's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition hall for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collections . __eou__  Private collectors ! Oh , they must have excellent collections . I'll go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , David , don't keep me in suspense ! __eou__
 No hurry ! I'll tell you now . The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , jars and water abacuses for study use , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , butterflies , fans , mini musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars . __eou__  Enough , David ! I can't wait anymore . Let's go right now ! __eou__
 If you have interest in butterflies , you must go to the Butterfly Exhibition . Mr . Chen , owner of the private museum , has a large collection of specimen of over 1 000 species of butterflies from more than 20 countries for public display . Quite a lot of them are state-level treasures . __eou__  Mr . Chen himself has become an authority in this area , and master of butterfly sample making , I should say . __eou__
Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc . __eou__  Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry . __eou__
 Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry . __eou__  what's interesting to see there ? __eou__
 Oh , there's plenty . Flowers and plants from all over the world , of course . Besides , gardening techniques are demonstrated , modern facilities displayed , academic exchanges and seminars organized , and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day . __eou__  I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! __eou__
 I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! __eou__  Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . __eou__
 Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . __eou__  It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! __eou__
 It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! __eou__  Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo . __eou__
 I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick . __eou__  Are you often traveling by plane ? __eou__
 No , this is the second time . __eou__  That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit . __eou__
 Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure . __eou__  What should I do about it ? __eou__
 Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep . __eou__  So , you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well . __eou__
 Let's go to the lake and camp on the south side . __eou__  Do you want to take the jet ski ? __eou__
 Zhouzhuang . __eou__  How long does the tour take ? __eou__

 It's about 300 yuan . __eou__  I know . Thank you very much . __eou__
 I know . Thank you very much . __eou__  That's all right . May you have a good trip ! __eou__
 That's all right . May you have a good trip ! __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
What a wonderful sight ! __eou__  Yes . I've dreamed a thousand times that I could lie down here to relax . __eou__

 I'd like to stay here for all my life if possible . __eou__  So would I . Look , it might be going to rain . __eou__
 So would I . Look , it might be going to rain . __eou__  I don't think it will spoil our trip . __eou__
 I don't think it will spoil our trip . __eou__  It will give us better feeling and atmosphere if it rains . __eou__
 It will give us better feeling and atmosphere if it rains . __eou__  Let's kick off our shoes to walk on the green flag stoned roads . __eou__
 Yes . Steven Smith , room 609 . __eou__  Fine . This is your bill , Mr . Smith . Four nights at 100 dollars each , and here are the meals that you had in our hotel . That makes a total of 660 dollars . __eou__

 That's fine . Have a nice day ! __eou__  Thank you . See you later . __eou__
 I see . What a pity . I have to appreciate it carefully . __eou__  I am really sorry for that . __eou__
 My wife and me . The two of us . __eou__  100 yuan each , so you owe me 200 yuan . __eou__
 Here are your two receipts . __eou__  Thanks . What shall I do then ? __eou__
 Just give these receipts to the lady at the door to immigration . Don't worry , she'll ask for them from you . __eou__  Oh , I guess I'm a little confused . __eou__
 Oh , I guess I'm a little confused . __eou__  We are all the same the first time we travel overseas . You guys have a nice trip . __eou__
 We are all the same the first time we travel overseas . You guys have a nice trip . __eou__  Thanks a lot . __eou__

 Yes . __eou__  You must weigh that as well . __eou__
 It's 10 yuan . __eou__  Here you are . __eou__
 I'm a little nervous . I have never flown before . __eou__  There is nothing at all to worry about . Once you're in the air , it's just like sitting in your own living room . It's going to be a very pleasant flight . __eou__
 About nine-thirty in the morning . __eou__  Then shall we arrange the bellboy to pick up your luggage at 9:00 ? __eou__
 Yes , I do . __eou__  Then I'd like to suggest you try Anchor Inn on Seaside Drive . __eou__
 Without is fine . __eou__  A double room without a view for just one night ? __eou__

 Let me see here ... yes , there's one left . __eou__  Ok . I'll take that one then . __eou__
 I like to travel light so I just have this one . __eou__  If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? __eou__

 Hold on a moment please ... Sorry , the flight from London has been delayed . It departed two hours later than scheduled.The whether in London was really bad . __eou__  You mean it will arrive two hours later than usual ? __eou__
 I am sorry.sir.Your plane has just taken off . __eou__  Really ? What can I do now ? I can't miss the important meeting . __eou__
 I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this carry-on bag with me on board . __eou__  Ok.Is this your luggage properly labelled , sir ? __eou__
 Yes , it is . __eou__  Ok.Would you please put all your luggage on the scales ? __eou__
 Yes , everything is fine . __eou__  What took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! __eou__
 We boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . __eou__  Then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! __eou__
 We finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on to the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . __eou__  Turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? __eou__
 Yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . __eou__  So where did you land ? __eou__
 We landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . __eou__  That sounds like a nightmare ! __eou__
 That sounds like a nightmare ! __eou__  It wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . __eou__
 It wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . __eou__  Have you had anything to eat ? __eou__
 Yes , if any one is available . But not over the wing . __eou__  I am sorry , there is no window seat in the non-smoking room . __eou__
 I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . __eou__  Where are you planning on going ? __eou__
 I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . __eou__  Would you recommend going there for a few days ? __eou__
 Personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . __eou__  You ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? __eou__
 I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t so far away . __eou__  Since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number . __eou__
 Yes , I think so.Flight KL638 is still at the airport due to the hurricane . __eou__  Oh , my god . If this flight is late . I will for Sydney.What can I do now ? __eou__

 Granted , it ’ s cheap , but the place is filthy , the beds are uncomfortable , there ’ s no A / C , the breakfast is pretty skimpy ... and the staff couldn ’ t care less about the guests . __eou__  Oh . I guess you get what you pay for . How long did you stay there ? __eou__
 Just one night , when my flight was canceled due to bad weather . It ’ s bearable if you just need a place to crash , but you definitely don ’ t want to book a vacation there .

 Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system . __eou__  Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . __eou__
 Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . __eou__  No , quite the contrary . __eou__
 No , quite the contrary . __eou__  Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ? __eou__
 Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection . __eou__  Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates . __eou__
 Excuse me , sir . This is your passport . __eou__  Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ? __eou__
 Yes . As a matter of fact , you can't board the plane without boarding pass . __eou__  Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . __eou__
 Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . __eou__  I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass . __eou__
 I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass . __eou__  But when does the plane take off ? __eou__
 Ugh , in about thirty minutes , sir . __eou__  Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head . __eou__
 Could be . __eou__  Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back . __eou__
 I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick . __eou__  Are you often traveling by plane ? __eou__
 No , this is the second time . __eou__  That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit . __eou__
 Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure . __eou__  What should I do about it ? __eou__
 Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep . __eou__  So , you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well . __eou__
 Before 12 a . m . __eou__  I see . Thank you . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . __eou__  I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . __eou__
 I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . __eou__  I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . __eou__
 I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . __eou__  Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? __eou__

 Sorry to interrupt , but my brother is still sleeping . __eou__  You mean the boy who felt carsick just now ? __eou__
 Yes . It's so strange that he slept all the time after taking the pills . __eou__  Oh , sorry , maybe I gave you the wrong medicine . __eou__
 Oh , sorry , maybe I gave you the wrong medicine . __eou__  What ? __eou__
 It's just sleeping pills made in America which is also very good . But don't worry . It has no undesirable side-effects . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 I took them from a travel agency . Look at those nice pictures , lash forest , palm fringed , white sand beaches , crystal blue ocean , they ’ re breath-taking . It is like paradise on earth . __eou__  That ’ s why it ’ s become a very popular holiday destination these years . Someone told me the service there is very good too . Are you planning to spend the holiday there ? __eou__
 Yes , I ’ m thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency . Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month . __eou__  How many days is the tour ? __eou__
 10 days . When I get back , I still have two days to go before work . Isn ’ t that great ? __eou__  That ’ s a perfect plan . Enjoy yourself . __eou__
 Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor . __eou__  I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ? __eou__
 Yes , July ninth . I will be there for seven nights . __eou__  We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates . __eou__
 The junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed , while the superior suite has a double bed and mini-bar . __eou__  OK , I would like to reserve the superior suite . Is breakfast included ? __eou__
 Excellent ! Our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . Let me show you some options . This is our most popular choice , our river guides will take you on a whitewater rafting trip followed by a ride in a hot air balloon ! __eou__  I don ’ t really think I ’ m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon . What else do you have ? __eou__
 China . __eou__  Is this your country of birth or residence . __eou__

 Almost three weeks . __eou__  Sir , you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you will be staying . __eou__

What is the hotel that we will be staying at like ? __eou__
 That is the best part . Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm N Included in the price is three meals a day , excluding beverages . You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush , green gardens .

 I had a wonderful time . The rooms are not very big , but they are well furnished . The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced . There ’ s a sauna and a Jacuzzi . __eou__  Do they have a swimming pool ? __eou__
 No , they don ’ t . they have a beauty parlor , but I didn ’ t go there . __eou__  What ’ s the service like ? __eou__
 It ’ s very good . Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends . __eou__  It sounds perfect . Did you have any complaints at all ? __eou__
 There was a problem with the internet access , so I couldn ’ t check my email , but I didn ’ t complain about it to the management . __eou__  I suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world . __eou__

 No , there wasn ’ t . There is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal . __eou__  One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips . __eou__
 One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips . __eou__  I know . At the inland hotel , they have an interesting policy . When you check out , you put some money in a special box at reception . Each evening , the money in the box is shared equally by the hotel staff . __eou__
This is the route I thought we could take on our hike on Saturday afternoon . __eou__  How long is it altogether ? __eou__
 It ’ s about six or seven miles . That ’ s about ten kilometers . __eou__  That sounds OK . So , we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall . __eou__
 That sounds OK . So , we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall . __eou__  Right . Then we turn left and walk up this small hill . The view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . We can eat a snack there . __eou__
 Right . Then we turn left and walk up this small hill . The view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . We can eat a snack there . __eou__  Then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church . __eou__
 Then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church . __eou__  We can spend a few minutes looking around the church . Then , we turn right and walk along this path . __eou__
 We can spend a few minutes looking around the church . Then , we turn right and walk along this path . __eou__  This path leads to the cave . Can we look inside the cave ? __eou__
 Then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path . __eou__  That ’ s right . __eou__
 That ’ s right . __eou__  How long do you think it will take us to complete the walk ? __eou__
 I think it will take about four hours , including breaks . __eou__  That ’ s fine . Are there signposts along the way , in case we get lost ? __eou__
 Yes , I have . I handed in my application form two weeks ago and I ’ m going for an interview next week . __eou__  Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . __eou__
 Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . __eou__  The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . __eou__
 The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . __eou__  What kind of documents did you need to present ? __eou__
 I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education , because I want a student visa . __eou__  Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected ? __eou__
 I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents . The embassy is very strict about it . You have to be quite careful . __eou__  Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities ? __eou__
 Jones . According to your website , the nightly rate is $ 50 , including breakfast . __eou__  We offer a 20 % discount for guests staying of Friday and Saturday . The total cost will be $ 80 , including breakfast . __eou__

 Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . __eou__  That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! __eou__
 It ’ s a difficult choice . The train is a litter faster , but much more expensive . __eou__  We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . __eou__
 We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . __eou__  Buses are more cramped and you can ’ t walk around . __eou__
 Buses are more cramped and you can ’ t walk around . __eou__  That ’ s true , but I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . __eou__
 That ’ s true , but I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . __eou__  Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . __eou__
 Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . __eou__  So , which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__
 Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed , we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car . __eou__  Did you get the camera ? __eou__
 Yup , it ’ s all set . __eou__  You ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything ? __eou__
 I ’ m sure ... we ’ Ve got all our bases covered . __eou__  Well , let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips ! __eou__
 But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train . __eou__  Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ? __eou__
 Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight . You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage . __eou__  Well , then , how much do I owe you ? __eou__
 Ah , a set of keys . __eou__  I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . __eou__
 I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . __eou__  That's all right . Enjoy your flight . __eou__

 I have a suit that needs cleaning . __eou__  Let me have it , please . I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway . __eou__

 In Boston . __eou__  Do you travel a lot ? __eou__
 Oh ... I go to see my sister twice a year or so . __eou__  Twice a year ? How long has your sister lived in Boston ? __eou__
 Nearly ten years . __eou__  I see , that's a long time.How much was the watch ? __eou__
 I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere.Would you like to see it ? __eou__  Yes , I'd like to see the receipt.Oh ! I see you bough the watch last week . __eou__
 Yes , I'd like to see the receipt.Oh ! I see you bough the watch last week . __eou__  Yes.Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it ? __eou__
 Yes , that's fine . I hope you enjoyed your stay in Boston ? __eou__  Yes , I did . I had a fine time . __eou__
 I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift . __eou__  Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance .

 I'm the general manager of the Far-East Industry Corporation . __eou__  You are here on business , aren't you ? __eou__
 Yes , I have been invited by the East Import & Export Corporation of China for business talks . __eou__  I see . Do you have anything to declare ? __eou__
 Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare . __eou__  Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brough in . __eou__
 Yes , it does . __eou__  Do you know when it leaves ? __eou__
 Well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace . __eou__  His residence ? You mean the whole palace ? __eou__
 Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The southern section , or the Outer Court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the Inner Court was for his royal family . __eou__  Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious . __eou__
 Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious . __eou__  Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor . __eou__
 Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor . __eou__  OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic . __eou__
 OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic . __eou__  Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living . __eou__
 Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living . __eou__  I agree . It's definitely a product of wisdom . Well , why were those small animal sculptures placed on the tops of the buildings ? __eou__
 Some of them are mascots and some are symbols of power . __eou__  Why are there so many yellow things ? Is yellow the lucky color in China ? __eou__
 Oh , no . In fact , yellow is the symbol of the royal family . __eou__  Just like the pattern dragon , right ? __eou__
 Exactly . Here is the Nine-dragon Screen . __eou__  Oh , it's really fabulous . I wanna take a picture here . __eou__
 In the van . __eou__  What about other expenses ? __eou__
 Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? __eou__  Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ? __eou__
 The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait ! __eou__  Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet . __eou__
 Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet . __eou__  As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time . __eou__
 Thank you miss ... Wang . I'm Bob Jones and I'll be handling your application . __eou__  Nice to meet you Mr . Jones . __eou__
 Nice to meet you Mr . Jones . __eou__  The first step is to determine your eligibility for a U . S . visa . Let's see here ... you're applying for a special business visa . Why is that ? __eou__
 Well , my first order of business will be attending a conference in Seattle , but after that I intend to spend two weeks visiting my friends . I assumed a business visa would be required . __eou__  I think a regular visitor's visa should suffice . With this visa , you can stay in the United States for up to 90 days . __eou__
 I think a regular visitor's visa should suffice . With this visa , you can stay in the United States for up to 90 days . __eou__  So I can attend conferences and do business on that visa ? __eou__
 Yes . You are free to do temporary business with this visa . If you were planning on setting up a new business in the U . S . you might need to apply for a long-term visa . __eou__  Oh , I see . I think 90 days is more than enough time . __eou__
 Ah , a set of keys . __eou__  I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . __eou__
 I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . __eou__  That's all right.Enjoy your flight . __eou__

 Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight.You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage . __eou__  Well , then , how much do I owe you ? __eou__
 No , early saturday morning . __eou__  We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM.Is that ok ? __eou__
 No , I haven't . I've decided I ' m going to travel very light this time . __eou__  What does travel light mean ? __eou__
 Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . __eou__  Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . __eou__
 Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . __eou__  You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . __eou__
 And I've got to drive.You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train . __eou__  Which is more expensive ? __eou__
 $ 79 a night . __eou__  I ’ d like a standard room . __eou__
 December 23rd , please . __eou__  How long do you plan to stay ? __eou__

 I'm the general manager of the Far-East Industry Corporation . __eou__  You are here on business , aren't you ? __eou__
 Yes , I have been invited by the East Import & Export Corporation of China for business talks . __eou__  I see.Do you have anything to declare ? __eou__
 Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare . __eou__  Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brough in . __eou__
 Next Friday . __eou__  I ’ m sorry , sir . We can ’ t accept reservations for next Friday due to over booking . May I suggest another hotel , sir ? __eou__
 Yes.There are trains at seven fifty-nine , nine eighteen , ten thirty-two and eleven fifty-five . __eou__  What time does the seven fifty-nine get to London ? __eou__
 At nine thirty-six.And the nine eighteen gets to London at nine fifty-five , the ten thirty-two at eleven nine . __eou__  What about coming back ? I'd like to come back about 7 p . m . __eou__
 There's one at nineteen and the next is at nineteen forty . __eou__  Mmm , how much is it ? __eou__
 Single or return ? __eou__  Return , please . __eou__
What a nice day ! __eou__  Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? __eou__
 Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . __eou__  Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__
 Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__  Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! __eou__
 Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! __eou__  Why not go again to celebrate our one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . __eou__
 Never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? __eou__  Yeah , I think so . __eou__
 Yeah , I think so . __eou__  Ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . __eou__
Finally we're on board ! __eou__  Yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . __eou__
 Let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle . __eou__  Ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . __eou__
 I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . __eou__  Good idea . __eou__
 Good idea . __eou__  Don't forget to keep the seat belt on . __eou__
 Yes ! __eou__  And no hijackers . __eou__
 And no hijackers . __eou__  Oh , you have too wild of an imagination . __eou__
 No need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . __eou__  We can take the train , that will be faster . I'II book the tickets tomorrow morning . __eou__
 All your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer . __eou__  Oh , yes , here it is . __eou__
 Oh , yes , here it is . __eou__  Sara ? __eou__
 No . Dad . We have a tour guide . __eou__  Also , take these pills in case you have any airsickness , and take some cold medicine , too . How about some band-aids ? __eou__
 No , I won't get sick . I promise . Ok . I've finished . Bye , Dad . See you ! __eou__  Take care , dear ! Be careful ! Oh Sara , wait a minute ! You forget your raincoat and umbrella . __eou__
 Take care , dear ! Be careful ! Oh Sara , wait a minute ! You forget your raincoat and umbrella . __eou__  Dad , that's all right . I don't think it will rain . And it doesn't make any sense to take that many things on a trip . Besides I like to travel light . Bye ! __eou__
 Yeah.There ' s an express that leaves in twenty minutes . __eou__  May I buy a ticket here at the station ? __eou__
 Go to window number eleven . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 We only need to verify your information against our records . __eou__  OK . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  Please show me your passport and Residence Permit . __eou__
 Two years . __eou__  May I know your occupation ? __eou__
 I'm a professor at a university . __eou__  Is that right ? Which university , if you don't mind my asking ? __eou__
 I teach at Beijing Normal University , English composition and some conversational classes . __eou__  Everything appears to be in order . Thank you for your time . __eou__
 An all-day pass is 30 dollars for adults and 20 for children . __eou__  Two adult passes , please . __eou__
 Here are our passports and tickets . __eou__  Let's see . Yes , here are your passports back . Did you pack your luggage yourselves ? __eou__

 No , sir . We left directly from the hostel . __eou__  Are these four pieces all your luggage ? __eou__
 Yes . Oh ! And these two carry-ons . __eou__  You'd better attach these stickers to your carry-ons . __eou__

 We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . __eou__  You got lost . You're kidding ! __eou__
 You got lost . You're kidding ! __eou__  No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . __eou__

 I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . __eou__  You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? __eou__
 When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . __eou__  Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? __eou__
 I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . __eou__  Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . __eou__

 You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . __eou__  Oh , that's what you think , huh ? __eou__

 I hope so . I really hope so . __eou__  Hah , hah ! See ? I guessed right . You weren't watching the road at all . __eou__

 We should make it , if there isn't too much traffic . __eou__  Is it the rush hour now ? __eou__

 No way . I ’ ll never find another apartment around here . But I don ’ t like the idea of paying three months ’ rent on an empty apartment , either . __eou__  I don ’ t blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . __eou__
 Hmm . Your file shows that you watched ' Titanic ' Monday night . __eou__  Monday night ? Monday night I was at a great concert . __eou__

 Sir , each copy is ten cents or one dime , whichever you prefer . __eou__  In the good old days , it was only five cents a copy . I'll be right down . __eou__
 In the good old days , it was only five cents a copy . I'll be right down . __eou__  Those were the good old days , sir , indeed . __eou__
 Well , except for one night , I enjoyed the hotel . And I loved New York , of course . __eou__  Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time . __eou__
 Thank you . I'll just print out your receipt , and then you're free to go . Here you go ! __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  If you don't mind me asking , how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel ? __eou__
 This hotel could use some insecticide , but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful . __eou__  That's very honest of you . Rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time . __eou__
 I hope you enjoyed your stay , sir . __eou__  I only had nine little problems here . Other than that , I enjoyed my stay , and I loved the city . __eou__
 I only had nine little problems here . Other than that , I enjoyed my stay , and I loved the city . __eou__  I apologize again for the cockroaches , sir . I hope you have a nice trip home . __eou__

 Each copy will cost you a dime , sir . __eou__  A dime ? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel . __eou__
 Well , most of my time here was pleasant . And New York itself is fantastic . __eou__  I'm glad you enjoyed the city , anyway . But please don't think too unkindly of us . __eou__
 I hope your stay here was satisfactory , sir . __eou__  This could be a great hotel , once you get rid of the insects . The city itself is great . __eou__

My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . __eou__  Let's see . It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p . m . for the movie ' Titanic . ' __eou__
 Let's see . It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p . m . for the movie ' Titanic . ' __eou__  That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . __eou__
 That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . __eou__  Okay , let me see what I can do for you . __eou__
 This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! __eou__  I'm sorry , sir . Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters . __eou__
You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw . __eou__  Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening . __eou__
 Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening . __eou__  Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night . __eou__
 Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night . __eou__  Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please . __eou__
 She deserves nothing but the best , of course . __eou__  In that case , I would suggest our own hotel restaurant . The chef , the food , and the service are outstanding . __eou__
I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . __eou__  Let me check , sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night . __eou__
 Let me check , sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night . __eou__  That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night . __eou__
 That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night . __eou__  Okay , sir , bear with me a moment . __eou__
 She strikes me as being very sophisticated . Only the best will do for her . __eou__  Well , what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant ? It is very upscale , with a three-star rating . __eou__
 My pleasure ! How much would you like to spend on your date ? __eou__  She will want an excellent restaurant , of course . __eou__
 She will want an excellent restaurant , of course . __eou__  You should know that our hotel chef was trained in Paris . The service and food are world-class . __eou__
 You can't go wrong with Gramercy Tavern . It's famous for its food , service , and live jazz . __eou__  I like that ! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight ? __eou__
 Sir , according to your file , you spent Monday evening watching ' Titanic . ' __eou__  Well , the file is wrong . I was at a great concert that night . __eou__
 Well , the file is wrong . I was at a great concert that night . __eou__  Well , this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong . Just a moment , please . __eou__
 Nothing but the best for a pretty woman ! __eou__  Sir , the restaurant you seek is right here . This hotel has a three-star restaurant . __eou__
 Great ! As you know however , the day in New York has hardly begun . __eou__  You're right . It's only 9 __eou__
 You're right . It's only 9 __eou__  Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags . __eou__
 Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York . __eou__  You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine . __eou__
 You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine . __eou__  I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely . __eou__  Okay . Let me think about this . __eou__
 Okay . Let me think about this . __eou__  Okay , sir . But don't take too long . You only have 30 minutes . __eou__
 Just say the word , sir . __eou__  Excellent ! Now , as you know , the day has barely begun . __eou__
 Excellent ! Now , as you know , the day has barely begun . __eou__  I agree . The dew is still on the grass . __eou__
 I agree . The dew is still on the grass . __eou__  I want to hit a few more places in the city , but I need a place to put my luggage . __eou__
 Regrettably , no . But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit . __eou__  Hmm . I'll have to think about this for a second . __eou__
 Hmm . I'll have to think about this for a second . __eou__  Okay , sir , but don't think too long . Your checkout is only 30 minutes away . __eou__
 That's good to hear . Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me . __eou__  You're right , sir . Your whole day is still ahead of you . __eou__
 You're right , sir . Your whole day is still ahead of you . __eou__  I still have time to explore more of New York , but I need a place to secure my baggage . __eou__
 Just present your VISA card , and there won't be any problems . __eou__  That deposit bothers me . Give me a minute . __eou__
 That deposit bothers me . Give me a minute . __eou__  Okay , sir , but remember how close it is to your checkout time . __eou__
 Great ! As you know , however , the day in New York has hardly begun . __eou__  There's nothing like getting an early start , sir . __eou__
 There's nothing like getting an early start , sir . __eou__  What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots ? __eou__
 You can leave your baggage in our storage space , with a deposit . __eou__  Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit ? __eou__
 I wish it was , but it isn't . They will still want a credit card . __eou__  It's always something , isn't it ? Let me think about this for a second . __eou__
 It's always something , isn't it ? Let me think about this for a second . __eou__  Don't forget that you have very little time , sir , before you have to check out . __eou__

 Egg tarts . __eou__  I thought you said you didn't have any food with you today . __eou__
 I thought you said you didn't have any food with you today . __eou__  I thought you meant vegetables and meat when you asked me . Things like that . I don't have any vegetables . __eou__
 I thought you meant vegetables and meat when you asked me . Things like that . I don't have any vegetables . __eou__  I'm sorry , Mr . Lee . Egg tarts are food too . We will have to confiscate these . __eou__
 I know . One out of every three travelers from Taiwan seems to be carrying them.They are being smuggled in by the thousands . __eou__  Oh , well . Not by me . __eou__

 That ’ s 1POJ7403 . __eou__  That ’ s correct . __eou__
 That ’ s correct . __eou__  Thank you ! __eou__
 Thank you ! __eou__  Is there anything else I can do for you ? __eou__
 Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . __eou__  How long does it take to get there ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . __eou__  Great ! I ’ ll take it . __eou__
 I understand . Thank you very much ! __eou__  Have a great trip . __eou__
this is the route I thought we could take on our hike on Saturday afternoon . __eou__  how long is it altogether ? __eou__
 it ’ s about six or seven miles . That ’ s about the kilometers . __eou__  that sounds OK . So , we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall . __eou__
 then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path . __eou__  that ’ s right . __eou__
 that ’ s right . __eou__  how long do you think it will take us to complete the walk ? __eou__
 I think it will take about four hours , including breaks . __eou__  that ’ s fine . Are there signposts along the way , in case we get lost ? __eou__
I'm glad we took the train . I don't like to ride in buses . __eou__  Yes , I agree . We can see the scenery better . In a bus , all you see are the roads . __eou__

 I agree . Buses bounce too much . After two or three hours , you feel too tired . __eou__  Look at that village ! __eou__
 I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . __eou__  that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours . __eou__
 that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours . __eou__  you ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas . __eou__
 you ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas . __eou__  so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? __eou__
 I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . __eou__  wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . __eou__
 There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go . __eou__  Did you buy tickets already ? __eou__
 Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets . __eou__  Outside or inside ? __eou__
 Outside , on the sidewalk . __eou__  Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait . __eou__
 Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait . __eou__  The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people . __eou__
 The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people . __eou__  MYOMA ? What's that ? __eou__
 Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA . __eou__  I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ? __eou__
 not far . About 150 meters perhaps . __eou__  ok . So I turn right at the traffic lights . Then ? __eou__
 then keep walking until you reach the war memorial . It ’ s a big statue of a soldier . You can ’ t miss it . __eou__  ok . Where do I go then ? __eou__
 you ’ ll see the national bank near the war memorial . It ’ s a big building and you ’ ll see a big sign on the front of the building . __eou__  got it . Thank you very much . __eou__
 No , it's just a couple of minutes . __eou__  Thanks very much . __eou__
 Thanks very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 That is the best part.Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests.You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this __eou__  Wow ! This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ? __eou__
 Of course ! The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . You can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard . __eou__  I ’ m sold ! I want to book this trip . I don ’ t care what it costs ! Money is no object ! __eou__
 Yes , but I'm very busy with work.And you know how it is , sometimes people don't visit the tourist sites in their own country . __eou__  I know . Are the subway trains easy to take here ? __eou__
 It might take a long time . Because there is a line , you know . __eou__  I know . But if you don't go in the Haunted House , you won't be happy.So I will wait for you . It's no problem . __eou__
 I know . But if you don't go in the Haunted House , you won't be happy.So I will wait for you . It's no problem . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__

 I'm sorry it took so long . __eou__  Don't worry about it . But how was it ? __eou__
Hmm . Let me try something.Wait . I have a reservation for someone named Sang here . But it's spelled J - A - N - G . It's not spelled J - I - A - N - G . It's for a Mr . C Sang . __eou__  Oh , that must be me ! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good . __eou__
 Oh , that must be me ! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good . __eou__  Yes , sometimes it happens , Ma'am . That's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number . I'm sorry about the inconvenience . __eou__
 Yes , of course.The pool is open until 10:00 p . m . So you still have about 45 minutes . __eou__  Good . __eou__
 Good . __eou__  Here is your key . Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall.Enjoy your stay , Ma'am . __eou__
 Here is your key . Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall.Enjoy your stay , Ma'am . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
I hope the food here is good . __eou__  Yes , it is very expensive . Maybe we shouldn't have come here . __eou__
 Yes , it is very expensive . Maybe we shouldn't have come here . __eou__  But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.If we are spending three days in Hollywood , I want to see at least one star . __eou__
 But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.If we are spending three days in Hollywood , I want to see at least one star . __eou__  I think we might not see any . __eou__
 I think we might not see any . __eou__  Did you like the tour of Universal Studios ? __eou__
 I thought it was O . K . But it really was too hot.And I think they should show people more . The exhibits should be more interesting . __eou__  I thought it was great . Didn't you like the special effects rooms ? __eou__
 We still have most of the tickets we bought.We can go on a lot of different rides if you like . __eou__  I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides.The other rides are for kids . __eou__
 I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides.The other rides are for kids . __eou__  Let's start walking to the Epcot Center then.According to this map , it is up this pathway here . __eou__
 Yes , my name is Carol Tiang . That's spelled J - I - A - N - G . __eou__  I'm sorry , Ma'am . I can't find anything under that name.Do you have your confirmation number ? __eou__
 No , I don't have it with me.But I know I have a reservation . My husband made it for me last month . __eou__  Well , let me look again . How do you spell your first name , Ma'am ? __eou__
 C - A - R - O - L . Carol . __eou__  I don't find a Carol in the computer for today . I have a Carol Larson here . But that reservation is for next Monday . __eou__

 His name is Lin , L - I - N . __eou__  I'm sorry . I have nothing here . __eou__
I'm glad I brought my jacket on this trip . __eou__  Yes , I didn't know Washington , DC got so cold in winter . __eou__
 Yes , I didn't know Washington , DC got so cold in winter . __eou__  What would you like to do today ? __eou__
 The Queen Street , I guess . __eou__  So is it the right way to the City Hall ? __eou__
But it's the White House . The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it . Probably we can only see a couple of rooms . __eou__  No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide . __eou__
 No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide . __eou__  Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House . __eou__
 Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House . __eou__  I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport . __eou__
 I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport . __eou__  So I can't take my gun then . __eou__
 So I can't take my gun then . __eou__  Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun . __eou__
 Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun . __eou__  Yes , it's true I don't . __eou__
 Yes , it's true I don't . __eou__  You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested ! __eou__
 You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested ! __eou__  What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ? __eou__
 No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much . __eou__  I'll be careful . Don't worry . I don't want to get arrested by the FBI.But how long does the White House tour last ? __eou__
 I'm not sure . I think it lasts about one hour . __eou__  Alright . We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Would you like a window or an aisle seat , Mr . Smith ? __eou__
 I want an aisle seat as close to the exit door as possible , please . __eou__  Very well . Do you have any bags to check ? __eou__

 Since last night . __eou__  Do you have a sleeping problem ? __eou__
 Yes , I even can't fall asleep these days . __eou__  I think you'd better have a further exam , and before the result comes out , try to relax yourself and take the medicine before you sleep . It will help you to kill the pain and make you sleep well . __eou__
 I don't feel like eating . And I cannot sleep well . __eou__  Do you have a fever ? __eou__
Good morning . __eou__  Good morning . __eou__
 Good morning . __eou__  What's the problem ? __eou__
 I'm running a high fever and feeling terribly bad . __eou__  How long have you had that problem ? __eou__
 Since last night . __eou__  Then , you'd better go to the Medical Department . But first , you should fill in the registration card and the registration fee is one Yuan . __eou__
 Yes , and it is 37 ° C . __eou__  Well , open your mouth and let me have a look . It is nothing serious . You haven't got a fever . But you should take the medicine and need have more rest recently . When you feel well , you could take more exercises , or play sports like basketball , running , and swimming . And eating healthy food , having more fruits and vegetable and drinking milk are good for your heath . __eou__
 He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here . __eou__  How long did the convulsion last ? __eou__
 About 3 minutes . __eou__  Does he have any other complaints ? __eou__
 Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever . __eou__  Have you taken his temperature ? __eou__
 It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now . __eou__  Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash . __eou__
 No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection . __eou__  Does he have to be admitted to hospital ? __eou__
 I have had a low fever these days . __eou__  Don't worry . I'll write you a prescription for a new medicine that works wonders . __eou__
I have a sore throat and my chest hurts . __eou__  How long have you been like this ? __eou__
 Two or three days now . __eou__  I think you've got the flu . There's a lot of it going around . __eou__
 I think you've got the flu . There's a lot of it going around . __eou__  What do you think I ought to do ? __eou__
 Yes , and I also have the runs __eou__  I'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better . One moment , please . Here you are . Take these tablets three times a day swallow them with water . __eou__
 Take on after each meal . __eou__  How long should I continue taking them ? __eou__
 It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning . __eou__  Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ? __eou__
 Yes , I never seem to have any energy . __eou__  I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest . __eou__
 I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . __eou__  Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . __eou__
 I've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now . __eou__  What are your symptoms ? __eou__
 I feel chilly , I've got cramps , I keep throwing up , and I feel dizzy and tired . __eou__  It sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . Do you feel thirsty most of the day ? __eou__
 Yes . I can't seem to drink enough . __eou__  Have you been drinking plenty of water ? __eou__
 No , just soda . __eou__  Ok . Well , we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated . First , let me feel your pulse . __eou__
 That seems to be a bit low , but that's not uncommon when you're ill . __eou__  Is anyone else sick in your home ? __eou__
 No , but my girlfriend has mono . __eou__  I see . I'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . The nurse will come in then to take your blood , we'll run some tests , and then you can go home . You should hear from us by this afternoon . __eou__
I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . __eou__  Do you have any other symptoms ? __eou__
 Yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . __eou__  How about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? __eou__
 No , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . __eou__  How did you get that burn again ? __eou__
 I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . __eou__  You haven't had much luck lately , have you ? __eou__
 No , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . __eou__  When's the last time you took your tablets ? __eou__
 I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . __eou__  I think it's time you took another dose of each . What would you like to drink with them ? __eou__
 that sounds good . __eou__  soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . __eou__
 Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 . __eou__  Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . __eou__  I strongly urge you to change your diet.You shouldn't eat too many desserts . __eou__
 Well , you'd better sit down for this . It has been terminal lung cancer . __eou__  Oh my god . Please save her life . __eou__
 We ’ ll try our best , but you'd better prepare for the worst . __eou__  I see , D . But I plead you to help her . __eou__
 Good morning , doctor . I have a terrible headache . __eou__  All right , young man . Tell me how it got started . __eou__
 Yesterday I had a runny nose . Now my nose is stuffed up . I have a sore throat . And I ’ m afraid I've got a temperature . I feel terrible . __eou__  Don't worry , young man . Lat me give you an examination . First let me take a look at your throat . Open your mouth and say'ah ' . __eou__
 Your throat is inflamed . And your tongue is heavily coated . You have all the symptoms of influenza . __eou__  What am I supposed to do then ? __eou__
 My wife . She suffers from a bad cold . __eou__  What symptoms does she have ? __eou__
 Fever and a bad cough . __eou__  I see . Don't worry , just a common cold . __eou__
 I see . Don't worry , just a common cold . __eou__  What kind of medicine does she need ? __eou__
Doctor , here's my report for my IVP examination . __eou__  Let me have a look . Can you see there's a stone in your kidney ? __eou__
 No , but it's painful . __eou__  Do I have to have an operation ? __eou__
 No , it's not necessary since the stone is not big . __eou__  Good , I can still attend the Olympic Games . __eou__
 Good , I can still attend the Olympic Games . __eou__  Yes , you're lucky . But you should go to the Ultrasonic Department to disperse the stone . Meanwhile , I'll give you some herbal medicine . __eou__
Good afternoon , doctor . __eou__  Good afternoon . What can I do for you ? __eou__
 I'm an athlete for the Olympic Games here . __eou__  About half an hour ago I fell on the ground and hurt my leg . It bled a lot . __eou__
 About half an hour ago I fell on the ground and hurt my leg . It bled a lot . __eou__  Let me have a look . You're very lucky because the cut is not deep . __eou__
 Let me have a look . You're very lucky because the cut is not deep . __eou__  First , I'll clean up the wound and then dress it . __eou__
I've got a temperature and my stomach hurts . __eou__  How long have you been feeling this way ? __eou__
 It all started the day before yesterday . __eou__  You seem to have picked up some kind of infection . __eou__
 You seem to have picked up some kind of infection . __eou__  What should I do ? __eou__
I feel dizzy and I have a headache . __eou__  How long have you been sick ? __eou__
Nurse , I am sure to die soon . They just don't tell me the truth , I know . __eou__  But I don't think so . No one has ever said a word that you are to die , only yourself . That means you are not willing to die , right ? Actually , you are recovering and what you imagine as your worry is slowing down the treatment . Many cases worse than yours turned out to be hopeful and successful . You must be confident . Your condition is much better physically , but a little bi difficult mentally . The most important thing for you now is cooperation with us . __eou__
Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . __eou__  You should go to the dentist . __eou__
 Thank you . I was operated on for gastric ulcer . __eou__  Is that so ? But I think It shouldn't keep you long in bed . __eou__
 I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? __eou__  Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . __eou__
 I think I caught a cold . __eou__  Do you have any symptoms ? __eou__
 Runny nose and coughing . __eou__  Do you have a fever ? __eou__
 I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so . __eou__  It's not serious . __eou__
 It's not serious . __eou__  Are you sure ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  What should I do ? __eou__
 The one right at the back . __eou__  I'm afraid we can ’ t save that one . It will have to come out . __eou__
 I'm afraid we can ’ t save that one . It will have to come out . __eou__  Will it hurt much ? __eou__
 I have a bad headache . __eou__  How long have you been like this ? __eou__
 For two days . __eou__  Do you have a fever ? __eou__
 I ’ m afraid so . Sometimes I feel hot and sometimes I feel cold . __eou__  Let me take your temperature first . __eou__
 I want to see a dentist . __eou__  Please pay the registration fee , 10 Yuan . __eou__
 Your throat is inflamed . __eou__  Is it serious ? __eou__
 No , that gets it for now , thank you . __eou__  Well , give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with . __eou__
 Absolutely everything . __eou__  What would you like to order ? __eou__
Hi . My minibar is empty . __eou__  You already finished off everything , sir ? __eou__
 I finished off everything . __eou__  Would you like anything in particular ? __eou__
 There's not a drop left of anything . __eou__  Is there anything in particular you want ? __eou__
 I finished it all . __eou__  Do you want the whole minibar , or just certain items ? __eou__
There's a big problem with my room . I'm in 507 . __eou__  Would you tell me the nature of the problem , sir ? __eou__
 I have cockroaches crawling in my room . __eou__  Perhaps you saw a silverfish , sir . __eou__
 Perhaps you saw a silverfish , sir . __eou__  I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see . __eou__
 I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see . __eou__  Sir , you haven't been drinking by any chance , have you ? __eou__
I have a little problem with room 507 . __eou__  What exactly seems to be the problem , Mr . Sandals ? __eou__
 I found cockroaches in my room . __eou__  Cockroaches , sir ? That's unbelievable . __eou__
 Cockroaches , sir ? That's unbelievable . __eou__  I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room . __eou__
 I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room . __eou__  Sir , are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times ? __eou__
I'm in 507 . I have a few problems with my room . __eou__  What is that problem , sir ? __eou__
 There are cockroaches in my room . __eou__  Are you sure , sir ? Flies I could believe , but cockroaches ? __eou__
 I've counted nine different cockroaches , and I accidentally stepped on another one . __eou__  Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel . __eou__
 Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel . __eou__  You dare to doubt me ? __eou__
 You dare to doubt me ? __eou__  I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor . __eou__
 Cockroaches have taken over my room ! __eou__  My apologies , sir . We'll give you a new room and refund the value of your current room . __eou__
I'm in 507 , and I have a big problem . __eou__  I'm so sorry . Kindly tell me what the problem is , sir . __eou__
 I'm so sorry . Kindly tell me what the problem is , sir . __eou__  Everywhere I look , I see cockroaches . __eou__

There's a major problem with room 507 . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . Please tell me the exact problem . __eou__
 This room is overrun with cockroaches . __eou__  There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel , sir . __eou__
 There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel , sir . __eou__  I stopped counting at nine . __eou__
 I stopped counting at nine . __eou__  Sir , this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors . __eou__
 Sir , this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors . __eou__  Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant . __eou__
 Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant . __eou__  I apologize , sir . Just a second , while I transfer you to my supervisor . __eou__
 I'm knee-deep in cockroaches ! __eou__  I'm so sorry , sir . We'll give you a new room immediately , and give you a refund also . __eou__
I have a little problem with room 507 . __eou__  Problems are what we're here for , sir . Please tell me your problem . __eou__
 This room is filthy with cockroaches . __eou__  Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them , sir ? __eou__
 I've already seen nine of them and , as they say , eight is enough ! __eou__  Sir , sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots . __eou__
 Sir , sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots . __eou__  You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement ! __eou__
 You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement ! __eou__  I'm very sorry , sir . Will you please hold while I transfer you to my supervisor ? __eou__
 We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym . __eou__  Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ? __eou__
 You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing . __eou__  Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ? __eou__
 The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir . __eou__  Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ? __eou__
 The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . __eou__  Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks . __eou__
 Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks . __eou__  Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded . __eou__
I think I've looked everywhere , but I haven't seen a swimming pool here . __eou__  This hotel has no full-size pool , but we do have swim stations in our gym . __eou__
 You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill . __eou__  All that exercise in a little pool ! Do I have to pay anything ? __eou__
 The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge . __eou__  Very good . Now can you tell me the hours of operation ? __eou__
 They're available anytime between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m . , seven days a week . __eou__  Wow ! I can't wait to change into my trunks ! __eou__
 Wow ! I can't wait to change into my trunks ! __eou__  The swim stations are very popular , sir . I hope you don't find a line down there . __eou__
 The service is free to hotel patrons . However , printing costs ten cents per page . __eou__  I see . And the other alternatives ? __eou__
 My name is John Sandals . __eou__  Hello , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days do you need that reservation , sir ? __eou__

Ahhchooo ! __eou__  You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ? __eou__
 No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies . __eou__  I never have seasonal allergies . __eou__
 I never have seasonal allergies . __eou__  Consider yourself lucky . __eou__
 Consider yourself lucky . __eou__  What are all the symptoms ? __eou__
 Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water . __eou__  That doesn't sound good . __eou__
 That doesn't sound good . __eou__  No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ? __eou__
 Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family . __eou__  Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol . __eou__
 Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol . __eou__  I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body . __eou__
 I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body . __eou__  That's pretty bad . __eou__
 That's pretty bad . __eou__  But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah . __eou__
 I've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts . __eou__  It sounds like you're coming down with something . __eou__
Doctor Lin's Office . __eou__  I need to make an appointment to see the doctor . __eou__
Being a diabetic , you're not allowed to eat certain foods . __eou__  Am I allowed to eat spicy food ? __eou__
 I'm not feeling well , doctor . I have a sore throat . __eou__  Have you any aches and pains ? __eou__
 Yes , my back aches . __eou__  I'll take your temperature . How long have you been feeling ill ? __eou__
 It began the night before last . __eou__  You have a temperature , but it's nothing serious . It's probably just the flu . I'll give you a prescription . Take this to the chemist's . Take one tablet every four hours . You should stay in bed tomorrow , and drink plenty of lemon juice . __eou__
 Lots of people are ill at the moment . __eou__  It's this cold weather we're having . __eou__
 I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches ! __eou__  Oh , my gosh , they're back ? Another room at once , sir , plus a full refund , of course . __eou__
 I have a sore throat and headache . __eou__  Do you feel tired ? __eou__
 Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you . __eou__
 In a word , cockroaches ! __eou__  Oh , no , are they back ? I'll give you another room immediately , sir , and a refund for tonight . __eou__
 Cockroaches have declared war on my room ! __eou__  Allow me to apologize . I'll give you another room right now , and a full refund for tonight . __eou__
 Yes , we try to accommodate all needs of our patrons , including fitness . __eou__  Where is your fitness facility located ? __eou__
 The gym is just below the lobby . Take the elevator or the stairs . You can't miss it . __eou__  Is there an additional surcharge for the gym ? __eou__
 The gym is open seven days a week , twenty-four hours a day . __eou__  Do you offer trainer services along with the gym ? __eou__
 Yes , sir . We try to anticipate all our guests ' needs , including fitness . __eou__  Great ! Where is it ? __eou__
 Sir , the gym is just below the lobby . You can take the elevator or the stairs . __eou__  Do I have to pay extra ? __eou__
 You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7 . __eou__  Great ! Is a trainer available ? __eou__
 But of course ! We have a great exercise facility . __eou__  Good . Now exactly where is it ? __eou__
 It's located right under our lobby . Just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down . __eou__  Is this going to cost me anything ? __eou__
 The hours couldn't be better , 24/7 . __eou__  Very good . Now , is there a trainer down there ? __eou__
 Yes , sir . We have a fine exercise facility . __eou__  I'm happy to hear that . Now , would you tell me where it is ? __eou__
 Yes , sir . I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory . __eou__  So , where do I go to exercise ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir , we don't have one . However , in our gym , we do have swim stations . __eou__  I'm not sure I understand . __eou__
 I'm not sure I understand . __eou__  Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in , but against a current . __eou__
 Sir , guests pay nothing to use the stations . __eou__  Excellent ! Now what are the hours ? __eou__
 The gym is open 24/7 , but the stations are open from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . only . __eou__  I'm going to change into my trunks right now ! __eou__
 I'm going to change into my trunks right now ! __eou__  I think you'll like the experience , sir . It's a great workout . __eou__
 Basically , a swim station is like a treadmill , except instead of running , you swim . __eou__  That sounds really neat . Is there an extra charge for these swim stations ? __eou__
 If you're a registered guest , you have free access to our swim stations . __eou__  Are the swim stations open 24 hours , like the rest of the gym ? __eou__
 To conserve electricity , the stations operate only from 7a . m . till 10 . __eou__  I'll go down there as soon as I can ! __eou__
 I'll go down there as soon as I can ! __eou__  I don't think you'll be disappointed . People really seem to like the swim stations . __eou__
 Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . __eou__  What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? __eou__
 Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . __eou__  OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? __eou__
 Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . __eou__  Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky.Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ah . __eou__
 A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible . __eou__  Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch o __eou__
 Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . __eou__  Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? __eou__
 We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! __eou__  Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! __eou__
 Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! __eou__  Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! __eou__
 Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! __eou__  Is that why you missed work today ? __eou__
 Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . __eou__  Www ! __eou__
 Www ! __eou__  I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! __eou__
 I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! __eou__  Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go . __eou__
 It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . __eou__  Yes , I need to refill it today . __eou__
 I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . __eou__  Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . __eou__
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__  Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . __eou__
 I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . __eou__  Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! __eou__
 Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . __eou__  Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! __eou__
 Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! __eou__  Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . __eou__
 Having a good diet is probably the most important thing . __eou__  It is very confusing to know what to eat . __eou__
 It is very confusing to know what to eat . __eou__  You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains . __eou__
 Sometimes I don ’ t know what the best foods are . __eou__  Fresh fruits and vegetables are important , along with protein and whole grains . __eou__
Everything's gone wrong . __eou__  I know , it's not as I had planned . __eou__
 I know , it's not as I had planned . __eou__  What are we going to do now ? __eou__
Okay , so we're agreed on 900 . __eou__  I'm happy with that price . __eou__
 I'm happy with that price . __eou__  Let's shake on it . __eou__
 No . __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 Oh , Kelly , I couldn't recognize your voice . Well , I'm fine . __eou__  Mr . Chang , I just want to tell you that we are leaving London for Beijing by flight CP 645 on Saturday morning . Could you meet us at the airport , please ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . Goodbye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
 I want to have a foot massage and a haircut . __eou__  A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . __eou__
 That ’ s when the masseuse walks on your back and massages you with her feet . __eou__  Sounds painful ! __eou__
Look , Bob hasn't made any progress on that project . __eou__  I see what you mean . __eou__
 I see what you mean . __eou__  We should have a word with him . __eou__
 Your doctor has requested a urine sample . __eou__  Am I supposed to pee into the cup ? __eou__
 He is looking to see if you have a bladder or urinary tract infection . __eou__  When will I know the results ? __eou__
Hi Bob , I won't be in work tomorrow . __eou__  Why , what's the problem ? __eou__

 For your high blood pressure , we have several choices of medications . __eou__  What types of drugs can I try ? __eou__
The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn . __eou__  Certainly , please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve . __eou__
 Ouch ! __eou__  There we go ! I got the blood that I needed . __eou__
 You need to stay hydrated on this drug , but most people experience little side effects . __eou__  Will that one medication take care of all of my problems ? __eou__
 If your white blood cell count is off , it could signal an infection somewhere in your body . __eou__  Is a blood test painful ? __eou__
 I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein . It will only feel like a little pin prick . __eou__  Oh , my God , that hurts ! __eou__
 Oh , my God , that hurts ! __eou__  That was it ! Thank you for coming in today . __eou__
 No , but the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure checked . __eou__  Do you have a history of high blood pressure ? __eou__

 Usually if your white count is off , the doctor suspects an infection . __eou__  How much will it hurt ? __eou__
 It is only a pin prick . I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find . __eou__  Is that my blood going into that tube ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve been feeling a little light-headed lately . __eou__  Has your blood pressure been high before ? __eou__
 If I have high blood pressure , it is news to me . __eou__  Usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms , so we call it the silent killer . __eou__
 Usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms , so we call it the silent killer . __eou__  What do you use to check for high blood pressure ? __eou__

 I ’ Ve been getting really short of breath , and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out . __eou__  Have you had the flu lately ? __eou__

 Peaches make me break out , but I don ’ t have any other allergies . __eou__  Does this happen all the time or maybe a little more in the cold weather ? __eou__

 No , I don ’ t have any allergies that I know of . __eou__  Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active ? __eou__
 It happens a lot when I work out . __eou__  I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma . __eou__
 I don ’ t have any symptoms of high blood pressure . __eou__  People with high blood pressure seldom know they have it , which is why we call it the silent killer . __eou__
 People with high blood pressure seldom know they have it , which is why we call it the silent killer . __eou__  What test do you do for high blood pressure ? __eou__
 It tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries relax at rest . __eou__  I am hoping that this test goes well for me . __eou__
 No , I ’ Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time . It just is hard to breathe . __eou__  Has anyone ever told you that you have allergies ? __eou__
 No one has ever checked me for allergies . __eou__  Does this happen more when you are under stress ? __eou__

 Yes , I would call three of my former classmates really close friends . We often get together and talk with each other . Whenever I counter difficulties , they are always ready to give me a hand . __eou__  What kind of people would you like to work with ? __eou__
 People who are honest , dedicated to their work and have integrity . __eou__  What kind of people you find hard to work with ? __eou__
 I'm thinking about that idea we talked about . __eou__  Do you think it'll work ? __eou__
Doctor , I have the worst toothache ! __eou__  How long have you had this pain ? __eou__
 For about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days . __eou__  Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ? __eou__
 You know , I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and I accidentally bit down really hard on one . __eou__  What kind of toothbrush do you use ? __eou__
 I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush . __eou__  Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ? __eou__
I thought about what you said . __eou__  And what did you decide ? __eou__
 I decided that you're right . __eou__  I'm glad you saw the reason . __eou__
 Mary's is handling it . __eou__  Is everything under control ? __eou__
Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner . __eou__  Okay , Bob , when will I see you ? __eou__

 He's in a meeting with Phil . __eou__  No problem , I can wait . __eou__
 It's the key for the safety deposit box . __eou__  Okay , thanks . __eou__
 Okay , thanks . __eou__  You're welcome , glad to be of assistance . __eou__
We're having trouble with Bob . __eou__  What's the problem ? __eou__
 He's been late for work twice . __eou__  Okay , I'll speak to him . __eou__
 That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out . __eou__  Has anybody spoken to him about it ? __eou__
 Has anybody spoken to him about it ? __eou__  No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to . __eou__
 No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to . __eou__  We really can ’ t ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ? __eou__
 Our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . It is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . It is the basement for the future cooperation . __eou__  That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes . __eou__
 The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great ! __eou__  You know , we are superior to other clothes companies . __eou__
 You know , we are superior to other clothes companies . __eou__  Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons . __eou__
 I'm Mr . Stephen's secretary . He has an appointment with Mr . Green today . __eou__  Yes , it will be at three o ' clock this afternoon . __eou__
 Yes , it will be at three o ' clock this afternoon . __eou__  I'm afraid we have to reschedule it . __eou__
 Not yet , Mr . Wang . But I'm working on it . __eou__  What seems to be the problem ? __eou__
 I just keep getting a busy signal . __eou__  Maybe his phone is out of order . Anyway , keep working on it . I really need an answer about the contract I sent him . __eou__
 Don't mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . __eou__  It's very nice of you . __eou__
Mrs . Lee , I ’ Ve stayed here for almost a week . And I really must leave tomorrow . __eou__  Please feel free to stay as long as you want . You know you ’ re always welcome here . __eou__
Oh , this is Monica __eou__  OK . Commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract . __eou__
 OK . Commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract . __eou__  Yes . Let's first define the inspection right . __eou__
 Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival . __eou__  Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ? __eou__
 Inspection is to be done by the China Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau . Usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment . __eou__  And can you tell me about the re-inspection ? __eou__
 Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month . __eou__  I see . How do they make testing and analysis of this item ? __eou__
 They always use the standard and method laid down in the contract . __eou__  What if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ? __eou__
I've been working hard for a whole year . I really need a break . __eou__  That's true . You need to take some time off to relax . __eou__
 You said it . I'm looking forward to my annual vacation . __eou__  When are you going to take your vacation ? __eou__
 Later this month . I can't wait ! __eou__  I really envy you . You know I'm not taking my vacation until December . __eou__

 Yes , I often do business through internet now . __eou__  Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? __eou__
 Yes , very gorgeous . Sometimes , I can deal with my business without stepping out of our house . __eou__  What advantages does it have ? __eou__
 Firstly , it is convenient . And secondly , it has low cost , because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service . __eou__  I agree with you . It will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition . __eou__
 I agree with you . It will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition . __eou__  The most important is that it is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time . Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers . __eou__
 The most important is that it is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time . Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers . __eou__  So cool , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . __eou__
 So cool , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . __eou__  Sure , but every coin has two sides . Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways . __eou__
 Sure , but every coin has two sides . Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways . __eou__  Will you give me some suggestion ? __eou__

 Sometime next year . __eou__  I ’ m looking forward to seeing you again . Take care . __eou__

I heard you were promoted to general manager of IBM ’ s China Head quarters . __eou__  That ’ s true . I got the news yesterday . __eou__
 That ’ s true . I got the news yesterday . __eou__  You did a good job for the company . So , this is your first day in the new position . How do you feel ? __eou__
 Not bad . I ’ m confident . And I like challenges . __eou__  I believe you are cut out for this position . __eou__
 I believe you are cut out for this position . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 I'm doing the business online . __eou__  Can you tell me the concept of e-commerce ? Now , many people mentioned the word , ' e-commerce ' , in front of me . __eou__
 E-commerce , or Electronic Commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling products or services over the Internet . __eou__  What kinds of channels can you use in e-commerce ? __eou__
 We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on . __eou__  What are the benefits of e-commerce ? __eou__

 We supply washers of all types and sizes . We have years of experience in the manufacture of washers . __eou__  We have read about this in your sales literature . Could you give us some idea of your prices ? __eou__

You will see that our prices are very attractive . __eou__  Do you take special orders ? That is , do you make machines according to the specific requirements from clients ? __eou__
 Sure , we do . __eou__  How long does it usually take you to make delivery ? __eou__
 As a rule , we deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant L / C . It takes longer , of course , for special orders . In no case would it take longer than six months . __eou__  Good . One more thing , we'd like you to quote us on CIF basis . __eou__
 Well , we want to have the largest share . Our company is much larger than yours , and we have been in business longer . __eou__  Let's look at that another way . The major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . __eou__
 We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . We are a good , small company---that's why you are interested . __eou__  Then , what would make you feel more comfortable ? __eou__
This is our best product . __eou__  How long will it take to make five hundred ? __eou__
 They'll be done before the end of the week . __eou__  Good . __eou__

 I use a soft bristle toothbrush . __eou__  Does it bother you when you have to chew a lot ? __eou__
 We have Techne , and it is available in lotion or cream . __eou__  Do you find that one works better than the other ? __eou__
 I have heard that the cream is longer lasting . __eou__  Is there anything I can take that will help with the itching ? __eou__

 A lot of people in my dorm are sick . Perhaps I picked it up there . __eou__  Did you take any cold medication ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve been taking vitamin C and zinc and trying to get some rest . __eou__  I think that rest and liquids are what doctors recommend for a cold . __eou__
 My grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold . __eou__  A pharmacist might be able to help you if your home remedies don ’ t work . __eou__
You look a bit under the weather . __eou__  I am not feeling all the great . I think I have that crud that is going around . __eou__
 I am not feeling all the great . I think I have that crud that is going around . __eou__  I know that it ’ s going around the dorms . __eou__

 In my opinion she will up about soon . __eou__  That ’ s good to hear . She is usually full of vein and vigor . __eou__
 That ’ s good to hear . She is usually full of vein and vigor . __eou__  I believe it . Well , I ’ Ve got to go back in . __eou__
 I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? __eou__  Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . __eou__
 I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts . __eou__  How long have you been like this ? __eou__
 It has been two or three days . __eou__  I think you've got a flu.Take this prescription to the chemist's and then go back and sleep . __eou__
 Don't worry about your flu . You will be OK soon . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
I feel chilly and I've got a pain in my abdomen . __eou__  How long have you had it ? __eou__
 Almost a week . __eou__  I think you've got a cold . __eou__
 I think you've got a cold . __eou__  What should I do ? __eou__
 Yes , I don't feel well today . __eou__  How long have you been feeling like this ? __eou__
 Since the day before yesterday . __eou__  How did you feel at the very beginning ? __eou__
 It began with a shiver then I perspired a great deal . __eou__  I see . You've caught a bad cold . I'll give you a prescription . __eou__
Your English has really improved in the two months you've been here , too . __eou__  Do you have to work late at the computer company again tonight ? __eou__
 No , I'm going to leave the office early today . My annual medical check-up is this afternoon . __eou__  How much longer will Mr . Schmidt be up in the mountains ? __eou__
 My temperature is 39 degrees centigrade . __eou__  How high was your temperature yesterday ? __eou__
 I didn't take my temperature but I felt feverish . __eou__  Will you open your mouth ? Your throat is swollen . __eou__
 Doctor , I can't eat any foods because I had a sore throat . __eou__  You seem to have a cold . I'll give your an injection and let me write down your prescription . __eou__
 I don't feel so good , Mom . __eou__  Lily , if you're acting sick just because you want to play hooky ... __eou__
You two are so health-conscious ! __eou__  Well , we try ! Here , I just made some carrot juice . Would you like a glass ? __eou__
 I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything . __eou__  Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain . __eou__
 I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . __eou__  It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! __eou__
 yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . __eou__  really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work . __eou__
 it's important to do proper exercises . __eou__  you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . __eou__
 you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . __eou__  the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . __eou__
 yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health . __eou__  I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . __eou__
 I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . __eou__  you bet it ! __eou__
 well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . __eou__  what are they ? __eou__
 one study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . __eou__  why ? __eou__
 the survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . __eou__  that makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . __eou__
 that makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . __eou__  and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat . __eou__
 and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat . __eou__  what's that ? __eou__
 nobody exercises anymore-not even kids ! The average american home has the TV on for 6 hours a day ! __eou__  wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . __eou__
 wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . __eou__  yeah , I guess so . __eou__
 yeah , I guess so . __eou__  you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . __eou__
 hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds . __eou__  so what happened ? __eou__
 well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . __eou__  you should have kept trying . __eou__
 Hi , Rock Sam ! Hey , I am surprised to see you doing so well . __eou__  Haha . Don ’ t worry , Betty . So tell me , what ’ s the latest gossip ? Unless you want to keep it to yourself . __eou__
 No way . Alisan Darling just got hitched in Vagas . __eou__  No kidding ! What happened to Ad ? __eou__
 Darling found out he was having a fling , and one new girl found out about Darling she dumped him too . __eou__  Was , talk about a double whammy . __eou__
 Oh , right . What a load off my mind . I really don ’ t like her . __eou__  Well I have to go , Rock Sam . You take it easy , OK . __eou__
 Well I have to go , Rock Sam . You take it easy , OK . __eou__  Thanks for the visit , Betty . __eou__

 Good morning , Dr Lee . __eou__  I have not seen you for a long time . How are you ? __eou__
 Not very well . __eou__  What are your symptoms ? __eou__
 I have nausea , and I am dizzy . Also I have a abdominal pain . __eou__  Where is the pain ? Could you show me please ? __eou__

 No . __eou__  What about here ? __eou__
 Not really . __eou__  How long have you been like this ? __eou__
 For about a month . __eou__  How about your appetite ? __eou__
 I am eating pretty good . __eou__  How about your bowel movements ? __eou__
 Things are going well for me , Dr . Smith . __eou__  Am I correct in thinking that you are here for your annual physical ? __eou__
 I'm very worried , doctor __eou__  Oh ? What are you worried about ? __eou__
 I'm afraid that I'm very ill . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . Why do you think so ? __eou__
 Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little . __eou__  How do you sleep ? __eou__
 Very badly , doctor . __eou__  Do you find it difficult to get to sleep , or do you wake up early ? __eou__
 Both , doctor . I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five . __eou__  Are you worried about anything ? __eou__
 Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake . __eou__  I see . please take off your shirt and lie down on the couch . __eou__
 No , doctor . I never have enough time for exercise . I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening . Then I can't get to sleep . Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep ? __eou__  I can , but I'm not going to . You don't need medicine . You need advice . Don't work so hard . Too much work is bad for you . Don't worry about your work.It ' s silly to worry . Take regular exercise . __eou__
 I don't know , Doctor . I'm ill . I have a headache and a stomachache . __eou__  Show me your torgue.What did you eat yesterday ? __eou__
 Well , Doctor , I . . . __eou__  Did you eat any cake ? __eou__
 Yes , I ate some cake . __eou__  Did you eat any ice cream ? __eou__
 Well , yes , I did . I ate some ice cream . __eou__  Did you eat any candy ? __eou__
 Well , yes , I did . I ate some candy . __eou__  Young man , tell me everything you ate yesterday evening . __eou__
 weki , Doctor . I went to a birthday party . __eou__  I see ! How many pieces of cake did you eat ? __eou__
 Three , Doctor . __eou__  How many plates of ice ream did you eat , young man ? __eou__
 No . __eou__  And this ? __eou__
 Yes . . . a bit . . . ouch ! __eou__  And do you feel anything when I do this ? __eou__
 Yes , that hurts quite a lot . __eou__  And you don't feel any pain anywhere else ? In you legs , for example ? __eou__
 NO , nothing . __eou__  Well , it's probably nothing serious.But I think we'd better have that shoulder X-rayed.We can't do the until the morning , though.So it'd be better if you stay in hospital for the night __eou__
 I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything . __eou__  Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain __eou__
 I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . __eou__  It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! __eou__
 Ryan , this is Malia , and I am afraid that I am feeling a bit under the weather . __eou__  Do you know what the problem is ? __eou__
 I have a horrible rash from poison oak . __eou__  Have you had it a long time ? __eou__
 The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days . __eou__  Have you been using anything for it ? __eou__
 I bought some over-the-counter lotion , and I am taking an antihistamine . __eou__  That will probably take care of your symptoms . I ’ ll see you tomorrow . __eou__
 This is Professor Clark speaking . __eou__  Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class . __eou__
 Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class . __eou__  Yes , what can I do for you ? __eou__

 I should be able to return by next Monday . __eou__  Fine . Well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . I hope you feel better soon . __eou__
 I have been feeling great , Dr . Smith . __eou__  I am happy that you have decided to come in for your annual physical . __eou__

 Yes , I am going on a cross-country bike ride on vacation and want to make sure that I don ’ t have any problems . __eou__  We are going to look at your heart and lungs , do a few blood tests , and see that your eyes , ears , and nose are all working as they should . __eou__
 The blood test is for cholesterol , white blood cell count , and blood sugar . __eou__  I have been feeling great . I don ’ t imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly . __eou__
 I went hiking and have terrible poison oak . __eou__  When did you get that ? __eou__
 I think I got it on Saturday , but it just showed up today . __eou__  What are you doing for it ? __eou__
 The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot . __eou__  Good . You probably should be much better by tomorrow . __eou__
 I have really bad poison oak and can ’ t stop itching . __eou__  How long have you had it ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve had it a few days , but the rash really got bad last night . __eou__  How have you been treating it ? __eou__
 I have some lotion that the doctor gave me , as well as an antihistamine . __eou__  That should work . I ’ ll see you tomorrow when you return to work . __eou__
 You are speaking with Professor Clark . __eou__  Professor , I am Kalina from your morning literature class . __eou__
 Professor , I am Kalina from your morning literature class . __eou__  Yes , how can I help you ? __eou__
 Oh , my God ! I hope you are all right . __eou__  I have a concussion , but I will be OK . __eou__
 I have a concussion , but I will be OK . __eou__  How much school will you miss ? __eou__
 I only need to take this week off . __eou__  I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ’ t be in class . See you next week ! __eou__
 Yes , I am Professor Clark . __eou__  Hello , Professor , this is Kalina , and I am in your literature class on Monday mornings . __eou__
 Hello , Professor , this is Kalina , and I am in your literature class on Monday mornings . __eou__  Yes , how are you doing ? __eou__
 I sprained my wrist , but the doctor says it will be fine . __eou__  How many days will you be out of school ? __eou__
 The doctor said I should be good enough to return next week . __eou__  I am glad you let me know that you will be missing class . Get well ! __eou__
 I am not feeling well . __eou__  What is bothering you ? __eou__
 I think I am beginning to have an asthma attack . __eou__  Would you like someone to walk you over to the Student Health Center ? __eou__
 I live in the dorms across the street , so I ’ ll be OK . __eou__  OK , then , hope you feel better soon . Check your e-mail for missed assignments . __eou__
 I ’ m pretty tired . I haven ’ t been sleeping well . __eou__  Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep ? __eou__
 I have enough time . I just can ’ t seem to fall asleep and stay asleep . __eou__  What time do you usually go to bed ? __eou__
 I don ’ t have one time in particular . I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired . __eou__  Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? __eou__
 I just lost my job , and I am unsure about being able to find another one . __eou__  Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ? __eou__
 I just feel funny . __eou__  What exactly seems to be the matter ? __eou__
 I have a terrible headache . __eou__  Do you think that you should go to the Student Health Center ? __eou__
 Actually , I haven ’ t been sleeping well . I am kind of out of it . __eou__  Is there some reason why you can ’ t get enough sleep ? __eou__
 I go to bed , but I just can ’ t get comfortable enough to stay asleep . __eou__  When do you turn in for the night ? __eou__
 I usually try to go to bed around 11 __eou__  Do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep ? __eou__
 My mother is ill with cancer , and I think about her a lot . __eou__  Do you ever meditate or read before bedtime ? __eou__
 I haven ’ t been able to get a good night ’ s sleep lately . I ’ m exhausted ! __eou__  Have you been too busy to get enough sleep ? __eou__
 I try to go to sleep , but I just can ’ t stay asleep . __eou__  How late do you try to go to sleep ? __eou__
 I go to bed when I finish my work . __eou__  Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately ? __eou__
 I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition . __eou__  You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head . __eou__
I have been having a lot of headaches lately . __eou__  Have you been having these headaches for a long time ? __eou__
 I have had headaches my whole life , but they have been getting worse lately . __eou__  Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve been under stress , but no more than usual . __eou__  Have you been getting enough sleep lately ? __eou__
 No , I only sleep a few hours a night . __eou__  Have you had any head injuries lately ? __eou__
 Yes , actually I fell skiing last week and hit my head . __eou__  I am going to send you for a CT scan , and I will see you again when we see the results . __eou__
 Now I know that something bad is up ! __eou__  Just relax . We will talk about it this afternoon . __eou__
Hello , the nurse said that you might have my test results in from the other day . __eou__  I would like for you to come in and talk about a few more tests that I would like to run . __eou__
 I just want to talk to you about the tests that I want to run . __eou__  Can ’ t you just tell me now ? __eou__
 I know for sure that something is wrong ! __eou__  Don ’ t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking . __eou__
I have been getting headaches almost every day lately . __eou__  Have you just started getting a lot of headaches ? __eou__
 I never had very many headaches before , but the last few weeks I have been getting a lot of them . __eou__  Have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ? __eou__
 My mother just passed away last Tuesday . __eou__  I ’ m sorry . How about sleep ? Are you getting enough rest ? __eou__
 I have been working really hard , and sleep has not been a priority . __eou__  Have you bumped your head or fallen lately ? __eou__
 No , I haven ’ t hit my head . __eou__  I am going to send you to a neurologist for a few tests . __eou__
Hi , the lab said that you would be getting my test results in today . __eou__  I like you to come in and discuss some further tests that I would like to run . __eou__
 I think that this is a bad sign . __eou__  For now , I would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned . __eou__
 You are scaring me ! __eou__  Come on in this afternoon and we will talk . It will be fine ! __eou__
I have had some really horrible headaches lately . __eou__  How long have your headaches been going on ? __eou__
 I get headaches occasionally , but they have been really bad lately . __eou__  Any unusual amounts of stress in your life going on right now ? __eou__
 I am getting ready to take my GRE . __eou__  Have you been able to sleep regular hours ? __eou__
 It has been hard for me to sleep with a bad headache . __eou__  Has anything hit you in the head lately ? __eou__
 I hit my head on a cupboard door a week ago . __eou__  Let ’ s have you come back in a few days and see how you feel . __eou__
 I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . __eou__  Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? __eou__
 Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N . __eou__  Alright Steve . Your social security number ? __eou__
 349-95- 8821 . __eou__  Do you have medical insurance ? __eou__
 Yes , I do . Blue Cross . __eou__  Do you have your insurance card with you ? __eou__
 No , I don't . __eou__  Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us . __eou__
 It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . __eou__  Yes , I need to refill it today . __eou__
 I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . __eou__  Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . __eou__
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__  Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . __eou__
 I have been feeling pretty good , Dr . Smith . __eou__  So , I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical . __eou__
 So , I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical . __eou__  Yes , I am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam . __eou__
 I thought this was the emergency room . __eou__  It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ? __eou__
 No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . __eou__  Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ? __eou__
 My left arm . __eou__  Can you fill out this form then ? __eou__
 No , I can't . I'm left-handed . __eou__  That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . __eou__
 That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . __eou__  Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . __eou__
 I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? __eou__  Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . __eou__
 The shoulder . __eou__  Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . __eou__
 Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . __eou__  It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . __eou__
 I'm bleeding too much . __eou__  We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? __eou__
 Thanks . Sorry . It just came as such a surprise . The baby isn ’ t due for another two weeks . __eou__  How long has she been in labor ? __eou__
 About fifteen minutes . __eou__  O . K . Are you planning on being in the delivery room , sir ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Please follow the nurse . She ’ ll get you ready . __eou__
Well , Mr . Smith . That ’ s a nasty infection you have . __eou__  Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , Doctor ? __eou__
Look , Jim . That man just fell down over there . __eou__  We better see if he ’ s o . k . __eou__
 I am so glad they called you . It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach ! __eou__  Does it hurt when I push here ? __eou__
 It ’ s mostly on my right side . Right here ! __eou__  Have you been feeling this way for awhile ? __eou__
 I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad ! __eou__  Have you eaten anything unusual lately ? __eou__
 No , not that I remember . __eou__  We are going to take you to an emergency room right now . __eou__
 Oh , my God ! It ’ s my stomach . It ’ s killing me ! __eou__  Where does it hurt the most ? __eou__
 Right here ! It hurts right here ! __eou__  How long has it felt like this ? __eou__
 I felt OK when I woke up , and then , suddenly , I had this really sharp pain . __eou__  Do you have a history of stomach pain ? __eou__
 No , and I haven ’ t done anything out of the ordinary . __eou__  Well , I think that we are going to have to get you to an emergency room right away . __eou__
Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . __eou__  You should go to the dentist . __eou__
 I can ’ t stand up ! My stomach is killing me ! __eou__  Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ? __eou__
 I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over . __eou__  Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ? __eou__
 No , and I don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches . __eou__  We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is . __eou__
 I have been having skin problems that aren ’ t going away . __eou__  Are you in pain ? __eou__
 No . Except for the rash , I feel fine . __eou__  Would Tuesday or Wednesday be best for you ? __eou__
 No , it just itches a lot . __eou__  I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ? __eou__
 No , but I have a low fever . __eou__  I have times available for Tuesday or Wednesday . Which one would work best for you ? __eou__
 I don ’ t feel so good . __eou__  What doesn ’ t feel right ? __eou__
 I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach . __eou__  Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home . __eou__
 My appointment was on Tuesday . __eou__  What time was it scheduled for ? __eou__
 It was for two o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__  I see your appointment . What day would you like to switch to ? __eou__
 Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . __eou__  Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky . Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ” ah ” . __eou__
 A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible . __eou__  Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics . You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening . You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals . Finally , I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless . . . just to clear up your lungs ! __eou__
 My appointment was on Wednesday . __eou__  At what time was that appointment ? __eou__
 It was for 4 __eou__  I can see the appointment that you had . What day do you need to change to ? __eou__
 No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . __eou__  Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ? __eou__
 My left arm . __eou__  Can you fill out this form then ? __eou__
 Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N . __eou__  Alright Steve . Your social security number ? __eou__
 349-95- 8821 . __eou__  Do you have medical insurance ? __eou__
 Yes , I do . Blue Cross . __eou__  Do you have your insurance card with you ? __eou__
 No , I don't . __eou__  Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us . __eou__
 Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . __eou__  Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! __eou__
 Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! __eou__  Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? __eou__
 Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . __eou__  I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery . You look amazing . __eou__
 I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . __eou__  You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts ! __eou__
Hello , I scheduled an appointment with Dr . Smith , and I can ’ t make it on that day . __eou__  What day was your appointment on ? __eou__
 My appointment was on Monday . __eou__  What time had you chosen ? __eou__
 It was for 10 __eou__  I am looking at your appointment right now . What day would you prefer ? __eou__
 Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . __eou__  Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! __eou__
 Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! __eou__  Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . __eou__
 Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . __eou__  Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . __eou__
 No , I haven't been registered . __eou__  Are you a medical or surgical case ? __eou__
 I'm a medical case . __eou__  Do you have your medical history sheet with you ? __eou__
 The doctor told me to stay about one month . __eou__  But there're no beds available now . Two patients will be discharged this afternoon , so you'll have to wait until then . __eou__
 Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . __eou__  Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! __eou__
 Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! __eou__  Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . __eou__
 Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . __eou__  Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . __eou__
 Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . __eou__  Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . __eou__
 Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes intense when I walk too much . __eou__  Have you ever had any trauma ? __eou__
 Yes , I have . __eou__  Does the pian become more intense at night ? __eou__
 Yes , ti does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too . __eou__  Do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ? __eou__
 Yes , I do . __eou__  I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree . __eou__
Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now . __eou__  Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken . __eou__
Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes come to see focus properly . __eou__  When did you last time have your eyes checked ? __eou__
 Two years ago . At that time I had no problems . Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away . __eou__  Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can telling me which way the “ E ” points . __eou__
Good morning , doctor . I've been suffering very much from a toothache lately . __eou__  Well , let me have a look . Will you sit down in this chair and open your mouth wide ? __eou__
I often sneeze after having a bad itch inside my nose . Sometimes this is accompanied by an itching throat . __eou__  Any other discomfort ? __eou__
 Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge . __eou__  Does it occur seasonally or all year round ? __eou__
 It has been seasonal during these past three years . __eou__  Are you sensitive to other things ? __eou__
 Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs . __eou__  OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis . __eou__
 My stomach hurts , Doctor . __eou__  Has this been a problem before ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  For how long ? __eou__
 I have had it on and off for the past three years . It's just gotten much worse these past two weeks . __eou__  Do you only feel this way when you stomach is empty ? __eou__
 After I've eaten , it goes away for a while . __eou__  Do you feel nauseous ? __eou__
 Yes , occasionally . __eou__  Do you have regular bowel movements ? __eou__
 I think so . __eou__  Let me take a look at your abdomen . Lie down on your back and bend your knees up . OK . relax ... Alright , it seems like you have a duodenal ulcer , but we'll have to run some tests before I can be certain . You should get a good rest first and try not to strain your stomach too much . __eou__
 I have a laceration on my left forearm . __eou__  Let me have a look . How did this happen ? __eou__
 I got hit by a car in an accident . __eou__  Was there much bleeding afterward ? __eou__
 No , not much . __eou__  Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ? __eou__
 No , not really . __eou__  You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long . __eou__
 I feel cold , and I'm shivering . I have a terrible headache and a sore throat . __eou__  How long have you been like that ? __eou__
 About a day . __eou__  Let me have a look at your throat first . Please open your mouth and say " ah " . __eou__
 Not so good . __eou__  Now , let me take your temperature . Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ? __eou__
 Your pulse is weak . __eou__  Do I have a temperature , doctor ? __eou__
 Certainly . I'll do it for you right away . Sorry the drugs on this order are out of stock . __eou__  What can I do ? __eou__
 I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning . __eou__  It ’ s a rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ? __eou__
 I bashed it against the chair in my room . __eou__  Does it hurt ? __eou__
 A little , but not much . __eou__  Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast . __eou__
 I guess it can't be helped . __eou__  You are right . Did you say 5:30 ? I'll make a note of it . Fine . __eou__
 No , I don ’ t . I ' m a tourist . __eou__  Then you need to register as a new patient . Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number . __eou__
I have a terrible toothache . __eou__  Which tooth is it ? __eou__
 Ar , Yes . There ’ s a big cavity . __eou__  Can you fill it ? __eou__
Dental clinic . This is Mr . Adams . __eou__  Hi . My name's David Johnson . I'd like to make an appointment . __eou__
 One of the back ones . __eou__  Let me see ... We can see you this afternoon if you can come in at four thirty . __eou__
 Yes , I bought some medicine at the chemist ’ s . I ’ Ve been taking it for three days . __eou__  Good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest . __eou__
 Yes , I have . I had to get a project finished . It ’ s done now , so I can relax a little . __eou__  Good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other symptoms ? __eou__
 I have a bad headache , but ... __eou__  Don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . If I were you , I ’ d just sleep , read a book , or watch TV . Here is your prescription . __eou__
Oath , I think I broke my leg . __eou__  Here , sir , sit down in this wheelchair . __eou__

 Yes , I have . __eou__  Now , Let me have a look at you . I ’ d like to listen to your chest . Breathe then , deep breath , that ’ s it . Cough , now again . I want to exam your throat too . Open wide , say A . __eou__
 The tests showed nothing wrong . a slight by infection . __eou__  What shall I do today ? __eou__

Hello , Doctor . __eou__  Well , What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Williams ? __eou__
 It's nothing serious actually , doctor . It ’ s ... Well , I get tired very easily recently , and I often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining . __eou__  How long has this been going on ? __eou__
 About two months . I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , I got fired this morning . I dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss . I was very embarrassed . __eou__  How was your appetite ? __eou__
 Pretty good , I'd say . __eou__  You haven't lost any weight , have you ? __eou__
 No , doctor . I've actually put on two pounds . __eou__  Unbutton your shirt , please . __eou__
 Overtime work is very common in companies . I can work overtime if it's necessary , but I don ’ t think we will work overtime everyday . __eou__  Do you like regular work ? __eou__
 Speaking . __eou__  I ’ m calling to offer you the position of computer engineer . __eou__
 Your starting salary is 3 , 000 yuan a month , but if you work well we will put you on our regular staff after six months time and your salary will be raised to 5,000 yuan a month . __eou__  I thought the starting salary is too low . __eou__
 My name is Zhuang Lingy . How are you , Miss Kelly ? __eou__  I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . __eou__

 I'm trying to send the instruction book by E-mail , but I failed many , many times . And there is something wrong with the net maybe . It's so slow . __eou__  Well , maybe the net is slow now . Try it again . __eou__
 I merely know how to send the direct letter . But I am not familiar with the attachment . __eou__  It's the same as usual . The only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment . __eou__
Hello , Westhaven Company . __eou__  Hello , may I speak to Mr . Richard ? __eou__
 Mr . Richard , this is Henry . I was interviewed by you last Tuesday . __eou__  You gave me a deep impression then . Can I help you ? __eou__
 I ’ m just calling to follow up on the situation of the salesman position . __eou__  We have made the decision to hire you . __eou__
 I have been a salesman . __eou__  How many places have you worked altogether ? __eou__

... So what I think we need to do is ( XXXXXXXXXX ) finish on time . __eou__  Sorry , Tom , can you say that last bit again please ? We didn ’ t get that . __eou__
 ( XXXXXXXXXX ) __eou__  Hello ? __eou__
 It is my honor to have this chance for this interview . Well , my major is commercial English . You know , and I am not only familiar with useful English expressions in business , but also learn some theories on this field . Besides , during my college learning period , I also attended some commercial activities to strive for the opportunity of practicing what I learned . __eou__  What is your greatest weakness ? __eou__
 Well , I was a diligent student when I stayed in my college . I dislike meeting the deadline , when I am working on a project . I am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule . __eou__  What is the greatest disappointment in your life ? __eou__
 Well , I lost my grandpa when I was only ten . I often recall the period when he fed me . __eou__  Well done ! Another question ! When will you start work , if you are hired ? __eou__
 Let me see . It's £ 800 per set CIF London . __eou__  What commission terms can you offer ? __eou__
 Usually the commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts . __eou__  Couldn't you raise the commission to five percent ? __eou__
Our benefits usually include medical insurance , public accumulation fund and allowances . __eou__  What are the allowances ? __eou__
 If you go on a business trip , you will enjoy the allowance . It is 200 yuan per day . __eou__  Well , I see . And what about the vacation in our company ? __eou__
 What kind of cottons are they ? May I see your list ? Ah , machine prints . __eou__  Yes , mainly prints . There are a few plain as well . Here they are . __eou__
 Yes , mainly prints . There are a few plain as well . Here they are . __eou__  I see . And the quantities . __eou__
 200 rolls of each . Make it 200 rolls for each sample . __eou__  How many rolls altogether ? __eou__
 Twenty prints and five plain . That makes 5,000 rolls in all . __eou__  Six weeks , did you say ? __eou__
 Yes , five to six weeks . __eou__  We could manage the plain rolls in six weeks . The prints might be put off to eight weeks . __eou__
 I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about . __eou__  Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof . __eou__
 We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher . __eou__  It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? Let's still use cartons . __eou__
 I have to tell you that I can't be in today and tomorrow . __eou__  So sorry to hear that . What's wrong with you ? __eou__
 I feel sick and coughed a lot at night . __eou__  Is that serious ? You ought to see a doctor . __eou__
 By the middle of October . __eou__  It's too late . You see , in our market October is the season for the kind of commodity . So the goods must be shipped before October or we won't be ready for the season . __eou__
 Do you still remember we already have a New Year celebration on January 1st ? __eou__  Yes , sir . I remember it . But our Chinese usually celebrate the New Year on lunar calendar . __eou__
Well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment . __eou__  Because this order is a comparatively big one , we would like to pay by time L / C , say , 60 days L / C . __eou__
 Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . __eou__  We can have a rest now after this tough interview . __eou__
 Right . __eou__  Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . __eou__
 Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . __eou__  Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . __eou__
 Actually not so good . That's why we made a special trip to see you . __eou__  OK , let me hear it . I'd be glad to help if I can . __eou__
 I would like to explain to you our financial position . The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . __eou__  But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . __eou__
 But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . __eou__  Well , in fact , it is beyond our financial capability . __eou__
 Well , in fact , it is beyond our financial capability . __eou__  In what way can we solve the problem ? __eou__
 Yes . But the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks . __eou__  So , we propose your company apply to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for a long-term loan . Six months before each shipment , you through Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation open , in our favour , an irrevocable , dividable L / C which is to remain valid for two months . __eou__
 It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . __eou__  What about a draft at 120 days sight ? __eou__
You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed . __eou__  Of course , just five minutes ago I got the phone call from Future Clothes Company and I was told to start my trial period in that company next Monday . __eou__
 Of course , just five minutes ago I got the phone call from Future Clothes Company and I was told to start my trial period in that company next Monday . __eou__  Congratulations ! Let's get together sometime . __eou__
 First , you have had an impressive growth record , ever since the company had been founded for half a century . Second , I can improve myself by working here . __eou__  Well , please look at the employment contract . I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved . __eou__
 Yes , any approved overtime of more than two hours will be paid twice of the salary or take time-off . __eou__  That's exactly my understanding . __eou__
 That's exactly my understanding . __eou__  Good . Now , you sign here , you can start work the beginning of next month . __eou__
 As you know , I have accepted three new programs in our company this year , but I am not sure I can do my work well . And right now my dilemma is that I can not find a person whom I can trust for these three programs . __eou__  What do you think we can do about this ? __eou__
Good morning . My name is Penny White . I'm new here . __eou__  Nice to meet you . My name is Tyler Smith . Let's go to your office desk , follow me please . __eou__
 I've worked in the Production Department for two years . __eou__  Could you introduce your biggest accomplishments in your last job ? __eou__
 Working with my colleagues , we were able to increase the production efficiency by 5 % . __eou__  Great ! Could you tell me your educational background ? __eou__
 Yes . I got a bachelor's degree in English from Beijing University . __eou__  Why are you willing to work for our company ? __eou__
 I can get more promotion in your company . __eou__  OK , that's all . We'll inform you in two days . __eou__
 I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . That will be embarrassing . __eou__  Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed . __eou__
 Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed . __eou__  I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that . __eou__
 I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that . __eou__  That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period . __eou__
 That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period . __eou__  I know what you are talking about . The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . There is no surprise during the actual review . __eou__
 Of course . I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . And since I was employed , I have been working on them . Madam , how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ? __eou__  How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ? __eou__
 I suppose so . I tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process . Certainly without my colleagues ' help , I could not do these things in such a short period . __eou__  Yes . And you also overworked in last month , when Steven asked for leave . I have been very satisfied with your performance . And your dependability has been a great asset . __eou__
 Yes . And you also overworked in last month , when Steven asked for leave . I have been very satisfied with your performance . And your dependability has been a great asset . __eou__  Thanks for your praise , Madam . __eou__
 Yes . The contract must be kept . __eou__  OK . I know . But Bob wanted to change shifts with me tonight . __eou__
 He said he would celebrate his girlfriend's birthday . __eou__  Don't worry . I will tell him about that . __eou__
OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed . __eou__  Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . __eou__  I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? __eou__
 OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . __eou__  May I interrupt you for a moment ? __eou__
 Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . __eou__  I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? __eou__
 Maybe next weekend . She only mentioned this before she left . __eou__  Well , the reason why I am calling is to tell her that our appointment in next month will have to be postponed . And the exact time for this meeting will be discussed after she comes back . __eou__
 Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet . __eou__  I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there . __eou__
 I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there . __eou__  I am sure that document was filed . __eou__
 I am sure that document was filed . __eou__  Well , let me check again under a different heading . __eou__
 We have thought of you very carefully , but the other candidate has more experience . __eou__  Experience is indeed very important , but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ? __eou__
Good morning , Mr . Zhang , this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company . __eou__  Hi , Jimmy , good morning . __eou__
 Hi , Jimmy , good morning . __eou__  I regret to tell you that the position of Sales Manager has gone to another person . __eou__
 I see . __eou__  We really believe that you are a highly qualified person . But the other candidate has several years of related experiences . __eou__
 We really believe that you are a highly qualified person . But the other candidate has several years of related experiences . __eou__  Maybe that is true . But I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime , and I do not mind a lot of business travel . __eou__
 We surely believe you . __eou__  Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ? __eou__
 I want to show my gratitude for your hospitality . And I believe me trip here will be meaningful and our cooperation will go deeper and stabler in near future . Through the communication , we can know more about each other . Thank you so much for your consideration . __eou__  Well , I also hope our cooperation will be never-ending . Thank you again . __eou__
 Yes . I have given all the designers notice of meeting by telephone . __eou__  Is the room ready for the lecture now ? __eou__
 Yes , I have prepared . I have also prepared a meeting memo . __eou__  Excellent . How about the microphone and speaker ? __eou__
 I have also got them ready for the lecture . __eou__  Write up the official notice in duplicate . Do not forget to put name cards and pens on the tables for our guests . __eou__
 Is that true ? I can't believe it . There are always some meetings in this company . __eou__  Hush ! The wall has ears , you know . __eou__
 But , my overwork has not done yet . And it is driving me crazy . __eou__  My boy . I give you my sympathy to you . However , this meeting is said to be extremely important , so we have to attend it . __eou__
 It is to give honors and promotions to some colleagues who made outstanding performance last year . __eou__  I will be there after 20 minutes . __eou__
George , I heard our eighth generation computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contract with our company . You have done a good job . We are so proud of you . __eou__  Thank you . I never imagine that would happen . __eou__
 Thank you . I never imagine that would happen . __eou__  Hah , as the sales department director , you are the best . __eou__
 Hah , as the sales department director , you are the best . __eou__  Thank you . But I am not sure whether the manager is settling for it . She asked me to go to her office . __eou__

If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation . __eou__

I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ? __eou__
 To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year . __eou__  Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__
 I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least . __eou__  I'm afraid that's too much for us . __eou__

 I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that . __eou__  My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ? __eou__
 Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars . __eou__  It's rather too high . If you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously . __eou__
 The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units . __eou__  Can you reduce more ? __eou__
 Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets . __eou__  Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity . __eou__
 That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets . __eou__  In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set . __eou__

 Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . But I have no idea on the registering process . __eou__  That's not as complicated as you suppose . __eou__
 That's not as complicated as you suppose . __eou__  Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__
 It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field . __eou__  Based on what you said , does it mean that we can not have a trademark like ' genova ' , right ? __eou__
 Correct . And our country follows the priority of use principle . __eou__  Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ? __eou__
 I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work __eou__  Patent ? Are you also learning something about patent ? __eou__
 Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark . __eou__  You are well-informed . Can you tell me something about the Patent Law in our country from the book you are reading ? __eou__
 The purpose of the law is to protect and encourage inventions and to promote the development of science and technology . The law came into effect in 1984 , and it consists of 8 chapters with 69 articles . __eou__  Is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ? __eou__
 Foreign companies should appoint a patent agency , which is designated by our government to act as his patent agent . This task is usually taken by the Patent Agent Department . __eou__  How long is the duration of patent right for an invention according to your Patent Law ? __eou__
 Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . __eou__  I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China . __eou__
 I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China . __eou__  Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country . __eou__
 Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country . __eou__  I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ? __eou__

 I like it very much . __eou__  If I may ask , are you happy with your salary ? __eou__
 No , I don ’ t mind at all . I receive 3,000 RIB a month , after tax . __eou__  Is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place ? __eou__
 I ’ m afraid there isn ’ t . My boss only pays lip service . __eou__  What is your salary expectation for this position ? __eou__

 That's too little . Well , I'll come down to 120 yuan . __eou__  All right . I go up to 115 yuan , but not a penny more . Is that acceptable ? __eou__
 I always approach things very enthusiastically . When I begin something , I don ’ t like to leave it half-done . I can ’ t concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished . __eou__  What makes you angry ? __eou__
 Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job . __eou__  What did you say ? __eou__
 I told him that I hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years . __eou__  Did he want to know the reasons ? __eou__
 Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only . __eou__  That ’ s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ? __eou__
 In a couple of days , I was told . __eou__  Wish you good luck ! __eou__
 Wish you good luck ! __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . __eou__  What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? __eou__
 We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . __eou__  Can you deliver them earlier ? __eou__
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m a poor talker . I ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking . __eou__  Are you more of a leader or a follower ? __eou__
 I don ’ t try to lead people . I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together . __eou__  Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ? __eou__
 Yes , in most circumstances . __eou__  Are you available for travel ? __eou__

 Maybe so . But I'm fast learner and I'm willing to work overtime to learn the business . __eou__  I'm sure you are . __eou__
 I'm sure you are . __eou__  I must to ask you to reconsider your decision and give me a chance . __eou__
 We've had a few problems . One of the bolts has worked loose and a blade has snapped off . __eou__  OK . Make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade . Why is there oil all over the floor ? __eou__
 I think the valve is faulty . I couldn't regulate the pressure and the seal burst . I tried opening the emergency valve but it was jammed . __eou__  Clean up the mess first , then fit a new seal and check the valve . __eou__
 Speaking . __eou__  Hello , Robert . This is Frank . I'm coming to Guangzhou on the the 7th and I'd like to call in to discuss the project plan . __eou__
Good morning , Textile Import & Export Company . __eou__  Hello , this is Miller . I'm calling about the appointment with Mr . Zhang for this afternoon . Something's just come up , I'm afraid the appointment will have to be rescheduled , I'm very sorry about the change . __eou__
 Tomorrow afternoon , Um ... you see , I've made an appointment with Mr . Comet for tomorrow afternoon . In order to meet Mr . Zhang , I have to cancel the appointment with Mr . Comet , I'm afraid . __eou__  I'm terribly sorry , Mr Miller , but Mr . Zhang is really busy this week . __eou__

 Well , it'll take three weeks to demolish the old building and clear away the debris . We should be ready to start the construction work in week 23 . __eou__  How long will the sub contractors be on site ? __eou__
 About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan . __eou__  I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers . __eou__
 Let me check . It's 3.80 m . __eou__  Are you sure that's high enough ? __eou__
 Well , I'm afraid we've had a slight delay . __eou__  What's the problem ? We really can't have any delays at this stage . We're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget . __eou__
We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years . __eou__  That's excellent . How have you managed that ? __eou__
 Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system . __eou__  What does that mean exactly ? __eou__
 Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers . __eou__  What other sources of energy do you use ? __eou__
 No , we used to be on an industrial estate on the outskirts of York . __eou__  Why did you move ? __eou__
Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers . __eou__  Do you have many different suppliers ? __eou__
 We haven't had any problems so far . They offer a 24 - hour technical back-up service . We've called them in three times this month . They always arrive within a couple of hours . __eou__  That's good service . Do we have to pay extra for that ? __eou__
I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce . __eou__  It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation ! __eou__
 It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation ! __eou__  Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? __eou__

 Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? __eou__  Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . __eou__
 I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? __eou__  Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . __eou__
 So how do you intend to do that ? __eou__  OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . __eou__
 How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? __eou__  Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . __eou__
 I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? __eou__  Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . __eou__

 Experience is indeed very important , but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ? __eou__  Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ? __eou__
 Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ? __eou__  Maybe you could hire me on trial , if I ’ m not qualified for this position , you can let me go . __eou__

 Anything else ? __eou__  No , that's it . Thanks . Bye . __eou__
 I know I deserve it , but I can not find a way to talk with boss about this . __eou__  You ought to point out how valuable you are , and tell her those people who have the same situation also get the salary raise . __eou__
 The first is why you choose our company ? __eou__  I think yours is a well-known advertising company , so I ’ m sure to get opportunities to display my talent in advertisement . __eou__

It's directly opposite the entrance to the car park . The Security people will sign you in and give you a visitor's badge . My assistant will come down to meet you . __eou__
 That's excellent . How have you managed that ? __eou__  Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system . __eou__

 What made you decide to change your job ? __eou__  I ’ m working in a small company where further promotion is impossible . __eou__
 Why do you leave your present company ? __eou__  I never easily give up something that is valuable . Before I decided to quit that position , I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company . You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good . Of course , opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me . So I believe it ’ s worthwhile to come here to work . __eou__
 Why did you pick this organization ? __eou__  I'm very much interested in the position . __eou__

 Excuse me , sir , but are you Mr . Richard of World Trading Company ? __eou__  Yes . That ’ s right . __eou__
 Would you like something to drink , sir ? Do you prefer coffee or tea ? __eou__  Thank you . Coffee , please . __eou__
 You don't make any prior appointment , do you ? __eou__  No . I haven't , but I'll take only a few minutes of his time . __eou__
It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ? __eou__  We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for our house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful . __eou__
 Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ? __eou__  You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time . __eou__
How many people does your company employ ? __eou__  We have over sixty employees . We have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff . We started off with only ten people , so our workforce has grown a lot . __eou__
 What's your annual turnover ? __eou__  It was just over two million euros last year . __eou__
How long has the company been in business ? __eou__  For over forty years . The original company Davies Engineering - was founded in 1960 by the Davies brothers in a small workshop near Manchester . They closed down the workshop in 1980 and opened up a new factory in Leeds . __eou__
 When did it become CABS ? __eou__  In 1997 - when it was bought by a German company . They set up two more business in the UK . __eou__
 What does CABS stand for ? __eou__  International Air Braking Systems . __eou__
 Oh , great ! Let's discuss it together . Now , when am I off then ? __eou__  You're leaving on Tuesday morning . __eou__
 What time exactly ? __eou__  Your flight takes off at 8 __eou__
 Oh , am I seeing Mr . Li ? __eou__  Yes , you're seeing him on Thursday . You're inspecting the factory in the morning and having dinner with him in the evening . __eou__
Our usual supplier has let us down and I ’ Ve been looking through your parts catalogue . I need fifty GT670s . How soon can you deliver ? __eou__  Just a moment and I'll check . We ’ re expecting a delivery on Friday . We've only got ten in stock at the moment . I can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning . There'll be an extra charge for special delivery . I'll have to send them by courier . __eou__
Are you busy tomorrow morning ? __eou__  I'm free . What's up ? __eou__
 I'm free . What's up ? __eou__  Someone has to pick up the boss at the airport . __eou__
How long have we had the A3 printer in the sales department ? __eou__  Just over a year I think . Why , what's the problem ? __eou__
 Just over a year I think . Why , what's the problem ? __eou__  I'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it . Is it still under guarantee ? __eou__
 I'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it . Is it still under guarantee ? __eou__  I think the guarantee's just run out . Let me check . Oh , it's OK . We took out an extended warranty , it runs until next March . __eou__
Why have you changed your job so frequently ? __eou__  My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution . __eou__
 Good . Anything else ? __eou__  Yes , all the insurance will be linked with your work . We will issue an insurance policy . __eou__
Do you have any questions ? __eou__  Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ? __eou__
 Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ? __eou__  Yes , after you ’ Ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation __eou__
 Only three days ? __eou__  That's the company policy . __eou__
 What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ’ m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ? __eou__  Yes . That's the company policy . __eou__
Do you have some questions ? __eou__  Yes , I really want to know about the housing system in your company . __eou__
 Yes , I really want to know about the housing system in your company . __eou__  If you join us , our company will provide you a single dormitory . If you make great achievements , our company will offer you a flat according to the related regulations . It all depends . __eou__
 I also want to know if there's a holiday at your company , for I must visit my parents every year . __eou__  Besides the official holidays , our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year , which makes it possible for you to visit your parents . Any other questions ? __eou__
 Besides the official holidays , our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year , which makes it possible for you to visit your parents . Any other questions ? __eou__  No , thanks . __eou__
This is the schedule for the project . Any comments or questions ? __eou__  I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us . __eou__
Where are you employed ? __eou__  I have been employed as a secretary at a trading company . __eou__
 What do you think of your present job ? __eou__  I find it interesting . __eou__
 How do you get to office ? __eou__  I go to the office by bus every day . __eou__
 What does your work consist of exactly ? __eou__  My main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees . __eou__
 How much money are you making a month ? __eou__  5,000 yuan a month . __eou__
 Why do you plan to change your job ? __eou__  I would like to have a job that is more lively than my present one . Besides , I would like to practise my English in my work . As my present employer deals with China trade towards China only , there isn ’ t much chance to speak English . __eou__
 Why do you want to resign ? __eou__  As you know I serve as a secretary in my present company , I really want to look for a more challenging opportunity . __eou__
 What kind of work are you interested in ? __eou__  Just as you advertised in the newspaper . __eou__
Hi , Paulo . How are things going ? __eou__  Everything's going very well . The first phase of the project was finished three days ahead of schedule . We're on target to complete phase two by the beginning of week 40 . __eou__
 That's good news . What stage are you at now ? __eou__  Well , we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety inspector to give us the go-ahead to continue . I'm just going to meet him . Do you want to come ? __eou__
 Why ? __eou__  Mr . Chen can't make it today . __eou__
Is the new computerised stock system in operation ? __eou__  Not quite . The software engineers are testing it just now . __eou__
 Have all the operators been trained on it ? __eou__  Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week . __eou__
 How long will the system be down for ? __eou__  We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday . __eou__
How many places have you worked altogether ? __eou__  Three . __eou__
 What time do you go to work ? __eou__  I must be there no later than 9:00 . __eou__
 What time does the office close ? __eou__  I quit work whenever I get finished , usually about six o'clock . __eou__
 Does your work involve a lot of paper filling and typing ? __eou__  No , the secretary does this . It's not part of my job . __eou__
 What made you decide to change your job ? __eou__  I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging . __eou__
 When was it serviced ? __eou__  Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable . __eou__
 What's actually wrong with it ? __eou__  Well , it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays . __eou__
I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? __eou__  Well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so . It depends on the user , but about once a month is average . __eou__
 So if I don't print out very much , it could last a lot longer ? __eou__  That's right . It could last six months or more . This model's designed for heavy use . Don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head . __eou__
 Is there anything you don't do in-house ? __eou__  Yes . If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance . __eou__
 Is that more expensive ? __eou__  It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often . __eou__
Where can I find a spare hose for the pump ? __eou__  What size do you need ? __eou__
 What size do you need ? __eou__  25 mm diameter . __eou__
 They're in the blue cupboard . Anything else ? __eou__  Oh yes , some wire cutters . __eou__
 I ’ ll need to check . Sorry , we don ’ t have any in stock . But I can order some and send through the order today . How many do you need ? __eou__  Just one pair . __eou__
I haven't seen this machine before . What's it used for ? __eou__  It's a really useful piece of equipment . It's for smoothing rough edges . Here let me show you how it works . It's very simple to operate . __eou__
 Sorry , what do you mean ? __eou__  When you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to reorder . __eou__
 Of course , where do you want me to stand ? __eou__  Just there by the door . I need to measure the length of this workbench . We're going to replace it . OK - 3 m 47 cm . Let's round it up to 3 m 50 . __eou__
 I'm glad you're replacing it . We need more space to work on things . How deep will the new workbench be ? __eou__  Tell me what size you want and I'll order the wood . __eou__
Has my package arrived ? __eou__  I'm not sure . What does it look like ? __eou__
 I'm not sure . What does it look like ? __eou__  It's quite a delicate piece of equipment , so I hope it was well-packed . It's oblong-shaped , about 50 cm long . It's made of metal . __eou__
 What's going on over there ? __eou__  They're setting up the machine for a new run . __eou__
 How long does that usually take ? __eou__  About twenty minutes . __eou__
 What's happening at the far end ? __eou__  That's the packing line . The goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation . __eou__
 Yes , I'd like to see that . What does it clean exactly ? __eou__  It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades , trays etc . - and then sends it back into the system . __eou__
 What does the unit consist of ? __eou__  Well , it's basically two tanks – one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent , a pump and a washing unit . Oh , and there ’ s a cooling system and a filter . It's all controlled by a PLC system – that stands for Process Logic Control . __eou__
 What's the running speed of the machine ? __eou__  About 1,500 metres per minute . It's one of the fastest in the world . We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now . __eou__
 And what's the maximum output ? __eou__  If we're running at full capacity , it's 160,000 tonnes per annum . __eou__
Is the factory fully-automated ? __eou__  Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . __eou__
 What about supply of parts to the production line ? __eou__  Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . __eou__
 What about the smaller components ? __eou__  They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . __eou__
 So , is it actually paper at this stage ? __eou__  Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths . __eou__
How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ? __eou__  We try to recycle as much as we can . __eou__
 What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ? __eou__  We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . __eou__
 But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? __eou__  Yes , you're right , it does . But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill __eou__
Has your company been affected much by government legislation ? __eou__  Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . __eou__
 What about your use of raw materials ? __eou__  Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . __eou__
 What happens if you exceed the limits ? __eou__  We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . __eou__
 This is Mr . Smith of XYZ Company . When will he be back ? __eou__  He'll be back at about five in the afternoon . Could I take a message ? __eou__
Good morning . May I help you ? __eou__  Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Wang Li . __eou__
Where did you get assigned to go this time around ? __eou__  They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? __eou__
 They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? __eou__  Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . __eou__
 When do you leave ? __eou__  I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth . __eou__
 Mr . Smith , did you have a good journey ? __eou__  I just feel a little tired . You know , it took me 16 hours to get here . __eou__
 Yeah , that would be fine . What time ? __eou__  Is 12 o'clock convenient for you ? __eou__
Excuse me , but are you Mr . Smith from Britain ? __eou__  Yes , I am . __eou__
 Did you have a good trip ? __eou__  On the whole , not too bad . __eou__
 Anyhow , it's a long way to China , isn't it ? And I think you must be very tired . __eou__  Yes , I am , rather . But I'll be all right by tomorrow and ready for business . __eou__
 How long did the meeting last ? __eou__  The meeting was delayed by thirty minutes and it lasted for two and a half hours . __eou__
 Did the chairman ask for me ? __eou__  Yes , I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend . __eou__
 All right . Have you handed in my report to him ? __eou__  Yes , I did . Besides , here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting . I think you'll have to do some replies . __eou__
 Thank you , Anne . You've done an excellent job . Did they mention the date for the next meeting ? __eou__  No , they didn't . The chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting . __eou__
 I see , and how about the documents and the information ? __eou__  All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting . __eou__
 And what should a secretary do during the meeting ? __eou__  Of course , she should take minutes . __eou__
 And after the meeting ? __eou__  After the meeting she should type the minutes up , and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting . __eou__
 Yes , I will . Do you need it finished right away ? __eou__  No . This afternoon will be fine . __eou__
Mr . Black ? I'm from the Pacific Mechanical Company . __eou__  Oh , yes . Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later . __eou__
 For wood or for metal ? __eou__  For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? __eou__
 For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? __eou__  Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? __eou__
 Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? __eou__  Yes , quite free until noon . __eou__
 You're welcome . This is my duty . Anything else ? __eou__  Yes , you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer , and then send those materials to each business worker . __eou__
 OK . Would you like this report done in a formal or informal style ? __eou__  Please type it in a formal style . __eou__
 I see . Anything else ? __eou__  No , thanks . __eou__
Marco has fallen off a ladder . I think he's hurt his back . What shall we do ? __eou__  We'd better not move him . I'll get the first-aider . __eou__
You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ? __eou__  We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on . They are all phosphate-free , which minimises damage to the environment . __eou__
 What about the packaging ? __eou__  We try to use as little packaging as possible . Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want . __eou__
What sort of problems do you have with these machines ? __eou__  They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too . __eou__
Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ? __eou__  Yes , it's definitely a growing business . __eou__
 What do you recycle in your plant ? __eou__  Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . __eou__
 How is plastic recycled , then ? __eou__  Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . __eou__
 Is that the method you use here ? __eou__  No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products . __eou__
 How do you do that ? __eou__  By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets . __eou__
 Certainly . Does she have your number ? __eou__  She must have , but let me give it to you anyway . It's 01705 455623 . __eou__
 Fine , I've got that . And your company is ... __eou__  Rosedale Investments . __eou__
 Could you spell that , please ? __eou__  It's R , O , S , E , D , A , L , E . __eou__
 Thank you . And the message ? __eou__  It's about an invoice which is wrong . __eou__
 Have you got the number there ? __eou__  Um ... yes ... it's 856674 / ros . __eou__
Fastback Travel . How can I help you ? __eou__  Could you put me through to Dan Aykroyd ? __eou__
 Right , I think I've got that . OK , what's the message ? __eou__  Just tell him I'll call him when I get back from Australia . That's it . __eou__
 How often do you service the vans ? __eou__  They're serviced regularly . We give them a basic service every 10,000 km or so and a main service once a year , or every 100,000 km . __eou__
 I see . What does the service involve ? __eou__  Well , the same as for private vehicles really , but we do it more often because they get a lot of wear and tear . __eou__
 Can you carry out major repairs here ? __eou__  Yes , we've got all the necessary equipment . We can give the engines a major overhaul . If there's a serious problem , we strip down the engine and find the faulty component . Would you like to look around ? __eou__
How often do you service the pump ? __eou__  We take very good care of this particular pump . It's a crucial part of our process . We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month . __eou__
 How do you decide how often these things need to be done ? __eou__  Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble ! __eou__
What do you do if you find something that isn't on your list ? __eou__  It depends what it is . Once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . If there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . But if it's not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time . __eou__
John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? __eou__  I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement . __eou__
What's wrong ? __eou__  There's no power . __eou__
 Have you checked the fuse box ? __eou__  Yes , the fuse had blown and I've changed it but now the motor keeps cutting out . __eou__
What's wrong with the photocopier ? __eou__  The toner has run out and there's none in the stationery cupboard . __eou__
What ’ s happened ? Is there a problem ? __eou__  I think the gears have seized up __eou__
Are you looking for part time or full time employment ? __eou__  To start with I would like something part time with the hope that it can develop into something full time . __eou__
 So you are interested in being with a company for the long term ? __eou__  Yes , that's right . I like this city very much and would like to make my home here . __eou__
 Wonderful ! Do you already have your work schedule ? __eou__  Not yet , I pick it up tomorrow . __eou__
 Do you know what you will be doing yet ? __eou__  Yes , I'll be managing the guys on the dock . __eou__
 What about your company ? __eou__  Ours is a company special in exporting leather products . And what about yours ? __eou__
 Ours is a company special in exporting leather products . And what about yours ? __eou__  My firm has high standing in my country . My bank is the City Bank , New York . You may refer to it for my status . __eou__
 I'd be glad to , sir . But may I ask what line of business you are in ? __eou__  I'm in the electrical appliances . __eou__
 Will this do ? Your major is not related to banking , as you know . __eou__  I know that , but making a lot of money makes me crazy . __eou__
We're interested in your Drawn Works . What about the supply position ? __eou__  For most of the articles in the catalog , we have good supply . __eou__
 That's fine . By the way , do you quote FOB or CIF ? __eou__  Either can be done , though we usually quote on CIF basis . __eou__
 Then what ’ s your counter-offer ? __eou__  This is our counter-offer . __eou__
What do you think of our price ? __eou__  Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? __eou__
How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? __eou__  One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . __eou__
What are you doing here ? How about your resume now ? __eou__  I still have no idea what to do now . __eou__
 Don't act like this . Please have good thoughts in your mind . What's behind you ? __eou__  I could not agree with you more . But I feel worried about what to do next as soon as I begin to write my resume . __eou__
How's everything , Janice ? __eou__  I sent my resume to a computer company and am waiting for their call . __eou__
 Which company ? __eou__  Pineapple Computer Company . A secretary is needed there , and it is worth a try . Do you get any information or advertisement for employment ? __eou__
 Pineapple Computer Company . A secretary is needed there , and it is worth a try . Do you get any information or advertisement for employment ? __eou__  Yep ! I got some , in which I am interested . But ... __eou__
 Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen . Is it flashing ? __eou__  No . It isn't . __eou__
 But I can't move the cursor at all . My screen is frozen . What should I do ? __eou__  Have you tried pressing the Escape key ? __eou__
 Have you tried pressing the Escape key ? __eou__  Yes , but nothing's happened . __eou__
 Are you sure you're using the right program ? __eou__  Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours . __eou__
Is that a no-smoking sign ? __eou__  Yes , it is . As you know , some of the materials we use are highly-flammable so we have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory . __eou__
 What does that sign mean ? __eou__  It means there must be no naked flames or sparks anywhere near flammable materials . If the materials ignite , it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them . __eou__
 Have you checked your connection settings ? __eou__  Yes , they're fine . I suppose.the server might be down again . __eou__
 Should we use the stairs ? __eou__  Yes , don't use the lifts . We have regular fire drills so you'll soon become familiar with the procedure . And always shut the fire doors to prevent the fire spreading . __eou__
What should I do if I notice a fire ? __eou__  Raise the alarm by breaking the glass of the nearest fire alarm . Call Security , say ' Fire ' and give your name and exact location . At night you should phone the fire service from the nearest telephone . __eou__
 Should I try to put the fire out ? __eou__  If you discover a small fire , you can try to put it out with a fire extinguisher but only do this if you have been trained . Make sure you use the right extinguisher . They are all colour-coded and contain different substances to put out the fire . __eou__
 How about this post-trip ? __eou__  It's very good , and the result isn't too bad . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Of course . I will write a report about this post-trip , and then you'd better type it at the moment , OK ? __eou__
 Yes , what can I do for you ? __eou__  Nothing . I just tell you take care of it when you type , especially the address and telephone number of those new guests . You should make sure that it's no mistaken . __eou__
What's your plan for your future ? __eou__  I'd like to work in a law firm to enrich my experience and put what I've learned into practice . __eou__
 Have you had any previous experience ? __eou__  Well . During the college years , I worked as a trainee every summer at lawyer's offices . Does that count ? __eou__
 Well . During the college years , I worked as a trainee every summer at lawyer's offices . Does that count ? __eou__  Of course it counts . What kind of work did you do there ? __eou__
 Of course it counts . What kind of work did you do there ? __eou__  I did clerical stuff and ran errands . __eou__

Your definition on success ? __eou__  Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others . __eou__
 What ’ s your ideal job ? __eou__  Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week .

But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . __eou__

 What would your colleagues say about you ? __eou__  They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague . __eou__
What's your ideal boss ? __eou__  I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . __eou__

How do you deal with conflict in your present job ? __eou__  Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . __eou__

How do you get along with your boss ? __eou__  I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time .

Is it fair to China , do you think ? __eou__  It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question .
