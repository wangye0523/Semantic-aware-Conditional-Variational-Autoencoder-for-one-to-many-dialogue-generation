 Yes , I would . __eou__  ( After testing ) Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? __eou__
 Yes , I'd like to give it a try . __eou__  All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office . __eou__
 Thank you , I've learned so much from you . __eou__  That ’ s all right . Hope you can do better tomorrow . __eou__
 Good morning , sir ! __eou__  Good morning , please make yourself comfortable . __eou__
 Thank you , sir . __eou__  Your name and examination number , please . __eou__
 I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have . __eou__  Your products are very good , but the price you ask is much too high . __eou__
 If you consider our high research costs and excellent quality , the price we are asking is only reasonable . __eou__  I know , but we want 1000 pieces . This is a very large order . So , can you give us a 25 percent discount ? __eou__
 You ’ re right , I don ’ t want to pay , but I don ’ t want to live without pay , either . __eou__  Ha , ha , ha ! I agree . That ’ s not much fun . __eou__
 Of course not , I appreciate that . __eou__  Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__
 You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . __eou__  Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . __eou__
 I really appreciate your offer , but I have to decline it , because I have already taken another job which I prefer to work in . __eou__  You are welcome , Please call me if you change your mind . __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry , but I've just accepted another offer that I feel is more suitable to my needs . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 You ’ Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now . Thank you very much . __eou__  My pleasure . Good luck to you . __eou__
 Ei , OK , er .. Fred . Thank you for seeing me today . __eou__  No problem . No problem at all . Say , it says here in your resume you studied in California . Great place , isn ’ t it ? I studied in California myself . I really enjoyed it . What did you like most about California ? __eou__
 Thank you , madam . __eou__  We have received your letter and resume , and we thought we would like to ask you to come here for an interview . __eou__
 It is a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity for interview . __eou__  Have you brought your credentials ? __eou__
 Yes , please . I ’ m Mr . Peter , the Director of Personnel . What can I do for you ? __eou__  Nice to meet you , Mr . Peter . I ’ m Wang Sian . I ’ Ve come for an interview as requested . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  What was your major in school ? __eou__
 Yeah , that is very important . __eou__  Secondly , you need to create a good image in a limited time . __eou__
 I will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done . __eou__  I think you should make some preparations . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . What ’ s more , try to avoid a too causal style . __eou__
 You ’ d better not . Informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__  I've got it . I think I will wear a white shirt with a tie . Thank you for your suggestions . __eou__
 Okay . __eou__  Buy an expensive suit . __eou__
 That'll do it . The best way is to find the dressing color code of the company . __eou__  How ? __eou__
 Yeah , that's very important . __eou__  So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . __eou__
 I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__  That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . __eou__
 It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . __eou__  It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . __eou__
 But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . __eou__  I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__
 It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . __eou__  You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . __eou__
 I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . __eou__  You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . __eou__
 It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . __eou__  It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . __eou__
 But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . __eou__  How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ? __eou__
 Yes , I know . And next time I must make good preparations . __eou__  Good luck next time . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  As you know , Miss Wang , we are looking for an executive secretary with business background and good English skills . We looked into your resume and thought you might be a good candidate . __eou__
 I guess you ’ re right . I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe . __eou__  Good idea . __eou__
 I see . Thank you very much for your advice . Bye . __eou__  Keep in touch . __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  Thank you very much . I will introduce your property to our clients . When they want to see your property , I will give you a call . __eou__
 I'm not sure . I can't agree , dan . __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 Very well . __eou__  How long have you been the owner of your computer shop ? __eou__
 I will make it now . __eou__  And can you tell me what meetings I have this week ? __eou__
 OK . Monday is the big day for job ads . __eou__  And job seekers will certainly check the paper over on Tuesday . __eou__
 B , talking about salary is not smart . You are a new manager and you'd better learn more professional skills . __eou__  You are right , boss , but I need specific confirm to keep the future work better . __eou__
 Oh , I am sorry . I ’ m afraid I can ’ t do it now . I have to meet my supervisor in a few seconds . But I could mail it after that . __eou__  That ’ s fine . We ’ re going to drop in and see Jimmy tonight . Don ’ t forget it . __eou__
 I won ’ t . __eou__  Thanks . See you . __eou__
 This is wonderful . Thank you for doing all this for me , Miss Lee . __eou__  You are welcome . And , please call me Betty . __eou__
 That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer . __eou__  Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ? __eou__
 I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . __eou__  Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . __eou__
 That's fine with me . __eou__  Would you mind relocating ? __eou__
 As long as it isn't too far from this city , I don't mind . __eou__  It ’ s quite far away , though it's located in another part of the city . Are you planning to find a boarding house nearby ? __eou__
 I ’ ll do my best , but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations . __eou__  Have you updated your resume recently ? __eou__
 I ’ ll be sure and do that . I also need to pick out the right suit , shirt , and tie for this interview . __eou__  Definitely . Oh , do you have a reference letter ? __eou__
 OK . __eou__  All right . Thank you for coming today . __eou__
 Of course , if necessary . __eou__  Are there any other jobs waiting for me in the future ? __eou__
 I ’ m fine , thank you . __eou__  Good , then let ’ s get to the interview . __eou__
 Oh , yes . I often went on business trips in the past six years . __eou__  How many languages can you speak in addition to your mother tongue ? __eou__
 I think so . __eou__  Excellent . Well , thank you very much , Mr . B , and you'll be hearing from us in the next few days , either way . __eou__
 I think your background and experience are worth the compensation . __eou__  Does it include bonuses ? __eou__
 Of course , here you are , sir . __eou__  Call me Mr . Smith . __eou__
 I know . But hard work pays off , you know . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 Thank you . It's very kind of you . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 That's great . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Rose . __eou__  It's my pleasure . Well , then . I'll say goodbye . __eou__
 Well , the client is always right . __eou__  What else would I prepare , Sir ? __eou__
 Certainly . __eou__  And make sure to return my Rolodex to my desk when you are done with it . __eou__
 Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here . __eou__  Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . __eou__
 That sounds good . __eou__  Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ? __eou__
 Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you . __eou__  Thank you for your help . __eou__
 Oh , that would be lovely . Thank you . __eou__  Excellent . Have you had French food before ? __eou__
 Naturally . Each of us keeps one original and two copies . __eou__  Then I ’ ll come along three days later to put my signature on it . __eou__
 Of course we can . We can provide the quantity you ask for . __eou__  That's very good . Shall we sign a contract now ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . If your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract . __eou__  Here is our price list , our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery , if you can pay it within one month . we'll give you a discount of 10 % . __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  That's fine . Then let's sign a contract . __eou__
 Your price is rather out of line , much higher than we expected . We can't buy with your offer . __eou__  Well , what do you suggest then ? How about 8 % ? __eou__
 What ? You want to drive me bankrupt ! You can't expect us to make such a large reduction . __eou__  There's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great . __eou__
 This is already our best price . __eou__  But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order . __eou__
 I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote . __eou__  Can we meet each other half way ? __eou__
 I'm afraid I can't agree with you there . Your price is much higher than other companies . __eou__  You get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable . __eou__
 Go ahead . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__  I hope you can try to get them to step up production . __eou__
 They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in . __eou__  If that's the case , there's nothing to be done about it . __eou__
 All right . I'll take your words at that . __eou__  Good . Let's call it a deal . And we'll do our best to advance the shipment , but your letter of credit should be opened early September . __eou__
 I'd like to , but I'm afraid that my schedule is full this week . __eou__  What about next week ? Is it convenient for you ? __eou__
 Any time you say is OK . __eou__  All right , expecting you . __eou__
 Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__  Very well , Mr Zhang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . __eou__
 I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation . __eou__  I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . __eou__
 I see . I'll do it for you . __eou__  Thanks a lot . It ’ s very kind of you . __eou__
 OK . Let me see where to start . __eou__  I guess first I should prepare a resume , right ? __eou__
 Oh , good point . You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss . __eou__  You said it . At last you ’ d better attach a list of references to your resume . __eou__
 That's easy . __eou__  And one more thing , smile widely . __eou__
 Let ’ s see ... ' Wanted , manager for up-and-coming firm . Must have good organizational skills . Experience a plus . Please contact Betty Sue . ' Oh , I don ’ t know ... __eou__  Come on , what have you got to lose ? __eou__
 That ’ s no problem . __eou__  Do you have any other questions ? __eou__
 I am happy to hear that and I'll accept that . __eou__  By the way , are you married ? __eou__
 Yes , but have you made an appointment ahead ? __eou__  Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 I got it . Thank you so much . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go . __eou__  Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . __eou__
 Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . __eou__  I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now . __eou__
 No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__  Well , I was wondering what the salaries are like ? I mean ... are they much lower than the corporate world ? __eou__
 Go ahead , please . __eou__  How long is my paid vacation every year ? __eou__
 Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days . __eou__  Ok , thank you for your time and patience . __eou__
 Ok , I see . __eou__  If you succeed in doing that , you must attend the interview on time . __eou__
 Oh , that's fine . __eou__  Great . I have the banquet room reserved for a lunch on for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December . May I have your name and contact information ? __eou__
 Sounds good . Thanks for your help . __eou__  Thank you for choosing Bruno's . We look forward to seeing you on the 2nd . __eou__
 Oh , yes.Thank you . I'd be glad to . __eou__  You can look around our new workshops and the automatic machines . __eou__
 I see __eou__  Also several copies of your one-inch color photos . __eou__
 Yes , I have those . __eou__  You also need to prepare formal clothes for the interview ; a suit should be the best . __eou__
 I will get it soon . __eou__  Have a briefcase ready with all your interview materials in it for easy carrying . __eou__
 Ok , I will remember . __eou__  All these should be enough . Good luck ! __eou__
 Sure . We're on a pretty tight schedule , but we should be able to finish it just on time . __eou__  Are all of your team members on schedule ? __eou__
 That'd be very helpful . An extra weekend is all they really need . Thanks . __eou__  That's alright . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the new deadline . __eou__
 I will . __eou__  I know you have a tight schedule , so I won't take up more of your time . Have a good evening . __eou__
 Yes , I have decided to work with your company . __eou__  Good news for us . When can you start to work ? __eou__
 No problem . Thank you for calling me . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 Really ? That's good news for me . __eou__  You will have a six-month internship after you enter our company . During this period you can get 2,500 yuan a month , and after that you can get 3,500 yuan per month . __eou__
 Yes , I can . __eou__  Mostly short business trips , but sometimes long ones are also needed . __eou__
 Yes , I can . __eou__  After the business trip , you could apply for reimbursement of all the expenses , such as passage money and accommodation charges and so on . __eou__
 Oh , so am I . __eou__  Do you work there ? I have an interview today with Dale Mendoza . Do you know her ? __eou__
 I'm sorry I can't , because I haven't finished my thesis . __eou__  What a pity ! __eou__
 I hope you can come to our company to work . __eou__  I will give you an exact reply as soon as possible . __eou__
 Sounds good . __eou__  Thanks for your time . __eou__
 I ’ m afraid he's not in . __eou__  Will you ask him to call me collect when he ’ s back ? __eou__
 Yes , please . __eou__  How are you doing , sir ? __eou__
 Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
 Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time . __eou__  Ok , see you then , bye . __eou__
 There is too much static on the line . __eou__  I said that you are supposed to have an interview . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . __eou__
 This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years . __eou__  I hope you'll give a second thought to it . __eou__
 We'll have to discuss the problem later . __eou__  What about if we order a large amount of exercise books ? __eou__
 Maybe you're right . Thanks , Don . I feel better . __eou__  I'm glad to hear it . __eou__
 Please ask . __eou__  I was wondering what kind of resume do you prefer , an e-resume or a paper one ? __eou__
 Ok , thank you . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  Hi , Monica , Richard again . Have you ever heard about our company ? It is an international one with good reputation . We have a lot of successful cases . If you ’ re trying advance your career , I would love to help you . XYZ Company is one of our clients . They ’ re in need of the talent like you . Would you be interested in taking part in an interview ? It is scheduled some time within this week . __eou__
 Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity . __eou__  Ok , I see . Good luck to you . You have my number . Call me when you change your mind . I can send you more detailed information about our company and jobs you might be interested in if you give me your private e-mail address . __eou__
 Well , I will text it to you . Thank you , bye for now . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . Bye . __eou__
 Sure . What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in writing . __eou__  Let me see if I have that right . This contract is for six months of training , but if it isn't cancelled , continues for another six months . Is that right ? __eou__
 That ’ s not good for me at all . It'll have to be another time . __eou__  We must find some time to read report . __eou__
 That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . __eou__  See you . __eou__
 Yes , Sir . __eou__  These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . __eou__
 Maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future . __eou__  That would work too . __eou__
 I'm sorry we won't do so for a new employee . We only provide this benefit to employees who have made significant contributions to the company . __eou__  I understand . Will the company provide training ? __eou__
 Yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__  Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
 Thank you . It's very kind of you to invite me to such a beautiful place . __eou__  I propose a toast to your pleasant tour in China . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  This food is a Wax specialty . Please help yourself . __eou__
 No problem . We will offer you a room with one bedroom and a kitchen .. __eou__  That's great . Thank you so much . __eou__
 Yes , but now we are fresh out of staff quarters . __eou__  How will you solve the problem ? __eou__
 Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . __eou__  Thank you for telling me that . __eou__
 I got it . __eou__  Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . __eou__
 No , I don't . Please . __eou__  I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance . __eou__
 I see . It is the position desired __eou__  Yes . After that you should emphasize your skills , educational background and related experience . __eou__
 Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer on the matter . It's pending now . __eou__  When can I know whether I'm accepted or not ? __eou__
 Thank you . I'll go through it and tell you . __eou__  We hope you get on board with us , Please let me know as soon as possible . __eou__
 Thank you for hiring me . I'm very proud to be employed by your firm . __eou__  You are expected to report for on-job training on the 15th of May . Will you be there ? __eou__
 Well , I see . __eou__  Then you can write about his performance in college , including his academic achievements and his competence . __eou__
 It's easy to write those . __eou__  You can also state his personality traits , hobbies and relationships with schoolmates and so on . __eou__
 Yes , I know . __eou__  When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  You have read the relevant terms of the contract . Do you have other questions ? __eou__
 Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth . __eou__  I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job . __eou__
 Yes , thus the employer can know you very well , and then decide whether you are the right person . __eou__  You are very nice to tell me those . __eou__
 Since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there shouldn't be any problems for the contract . __eou__  May we once more remind you that the contract should be canceled by one month notice . __eou__
 That's a good idea ! So you don't need to worry about it . __eou__  I think so , too . What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company ? __eou__
 Good idea . It is convenient and fast . __eou__  You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely . __eou__
 Certainly . __eou__  I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . If it's too long , I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it . __eou__
 Good morning . Thank you . __eou__  I see that you have some impressive writing experience . __eou__
 OK . Let me send a memo around . __eou__  Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back . __eou__
 I don ’ t think he ’ s back today . __eou__  Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! __eou__
 I ’ m kind of useless in that area , but I ’ ll take a look at it . __eou__  Ah , thanks . __eou__
 Yes , that will be just as good . __eou__  Then shall we make it nine o'clock the day after tomorrow morning ? __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 That's a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . __eou__  I know what you're saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  Yes , Mr . Mason . I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry . She said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She should be with you shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? __eou__
 That would be very nice . Thank you . __eou__  Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor.There is a conference room already prepared . __eou__
 That'll be most helpful . __eou__  Maybe we could start with the Design Department . And then we could look at the production line . __eou__
I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon . __eou__  Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ? __eou__
 Well , you know the time of shipment means a lot to us . __eou__  I can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days . __eou__
 That's right , Ms . Bower . How are you ? I'm not sure if I ’ ll be able to fit you in this week , I ’ m afraid . __eou__  I understand , Mr . Carmichael . I'd be glad to make it some time next week . __eou__
 That is so thoughtful of you . __eou__  My pleasure . Take care and have a nice trip . __eou__
 Let's call it a deal . Hope to see you again soon . Keep in touch then . Byebye . __eou__  Goodbye . Thanks again . __eou__
 Oh , you needn't do that . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
 That's fine . I'll be waiting for you . __eou__  See you later . __eou__
 I'm terribly sorry , but I've already made arrangements for Wednesday . __eou__  That's a pity . How about Thursday ? __eou__
 That would be fine . __eou__  Great . What time would you like to meet ? __eou__
 OK , let's have that then . __eou__  All right . Well , I'll see you later . __eou__
 Oh , yes , I'd very much like to go . __eou__  That is great . Dinner starts at 6 __eou__
 I'll be there in time . __eou__  All right . Bye . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  How did the business trip go ? __eou__
 Thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! __eou__  No problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? __eou__
 Oh , thank you . __eou__  Do you mind if we talk about your schedule tomorrow ? __eou__
 That will be best . I'd like to have a good rest first . __eou__  And this is the schedule for Mrs . Watson . Eileen from our department will take care of her . __eou__
 Oh . __eou__  Don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office foe a couple of days ? __eou__
 How nice of him ! I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ? __eou__  I'll be here to pick you up at 6:30 . __eou__
 That's good . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Wood . __eou__  It's my pleasure . Well , then , see you tomorrow . __eou__
 I'm afraid there is a bit of a problem . in fact , he has booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon . __eou__  Tomorrow afternoon . Um ... When do you think I can come and see him tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__
 All right . Let's change it . Tomorrow afternoon at three . I am going to schedule it for that time and inform Mr.Liu about the change . __eou__  Thank you very much . See you tomorrow afternoon . __eou__
 Yes , of course . Thank you very much . __eou__  You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB __eou__
 OK . I'll be free from nine to eleven . I'll be there waiting for you . __eou__  We'll discuss the contract in detail . __eou__
 Sure . I'm really sorry for the trouble I've made . __eou__  Not at all . See you . __eou__
 All right , Mr . Green . __eou__  Have a seat over there . How are things going out in the office ? __eou__
 I'm afraid not . He has a meeting tomorrow morning . __eou__  Could I possibly make it early in the afternoon ? __eou__
 I'm awfully sorry , I have other plan . __eou__  Would you prefer some other time ? __eou__
 I'd love to come other time if it can be arranged . __eou__  Are you quite sure you can come next Tuesday ? __eou__
 Certainly , I'll be going . __eou__  What time am I supposed to pick you up ? __eou__
 This is Liu Fang speaking . __eou__  Oh , good morning , Mrs . Liu . I'm calling to see if you have received my resume that I sent to you by Email . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  When will it be convenient for her ? __eou__

 I see . Thank you very much . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 I'd be happy to help you . Name it . __eou__  My printer is broken . Can you print up a copy for me ? __eou__

 OK , see you then . __eou__  See you . __eou__
 I heard that there are some beauty spots and places of historical interest in this city . __eou__  Shall we go to the Tiananmen Square first ? __eou__
 That's great . I trouble you so much . Thank you very much . __eou__  It's my pleasure . Shall we go there on foot ? It's very near . __eou__
 Thanks . It was very nice to meet you . __eou__  It was nice to meet you , too . And thanks for coming in today . __eou__
 Go ahead , please . __eou__  in all the jobs you ’ Ve had , what was it you disliked the most ? __eou__
 Well , it is a little more than we had planned . __eou__  I think you will find I am worth it . __eou__
 I know . Let me think it over . __eou__  If you have any good jobs , keep an eye for me ! __eou__
 OK , that's fine . Thank you . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 Of course , I will . __eou__  Good luck ! __eou__
 OK . I will . __eou__  Have a nice flight back , and take care . Thanks for your call . __eou__
 Yes , I'd love to . Thanks again . Goodbye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
 Yes , I will . Have a nice flight back . __eou__  Thanks , good-bye ! __eou__
 Oh . Thanks a million . __eou__  It's a souvenir I bought for you from Rome . __eou__
 Better late than never . __eou__  So sorry , I don't mean to be . __eou__
 No , that's quite out of the question . __eou__  Please accept my deep apology . __eou__
 Bottoms up ! __eou__  Cheers . __eou__
 The same with the previous speaker , we must know how things stand with us . __eou__  Yes , we must keep a clear mind with the tough competition . __eou__
 That sounds reasonable . __eou__  Do I have paid vacation ? __eou__
 I expect to work hard , madam . __eou__  Do you mind going on frequent business traps ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Your main duty is to answer the phone calls and transfer them to the person wanted . __eou__
 All right . __eou__  If you have any questions . I will help you . __eou__
 Yes , certainly . __eou__  Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon . __eou__
 All right . I'll tell him when he comes back . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago . __eou__  That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy.Will he be back soon ? __eou__
 Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days . __eou__  I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Bye-bye . __eou__
 That's too bad . I can't wait that long . I have another appointment at ten . __eou__  Can the Assistant Manager meet you instead ? __eou__
 No , I have discussed the details about sales of our new equipment with the manager on the telephone yesterday . __eou__  Do you want to make another appointment ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago . __eou__  That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ? __eou__
 Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days . __eou__  I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned . __eou__
 I see your point , but I seem to be on bad terms with them . __eou__  Cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better . I am speaking from my experience . __eou__
 Thank you so much . __eou__  And you should read as much as possible to enrich the knowledge . __eou__
 That's a good idea . I can learn many useful things from books . __eou__  We're approaching the critical point for success or failure of this project . you'd better speed up and catch up with books . __eou__
 Well , I will do it better . __eou__  If you have any problem in your work , let me know . __eou__
 I can't wait to see the expression on her face when we dump her . __eou__  Don't jump the gun . She's in the driver's seat right now . You have to be patient . __eou__
 Don't worry . I'm patient , but vengeance will be mine . __eou__  Settle down , Elvin . If you're not careful , you'll give our plan away . Zina's smart , you know . __eou__
 To be honest , I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it . __eou__  You'd rather lose to WebTracker than do things my way ? __eou__
 No , it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions . __eou__  But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless . __eou__
 OK , I know what you mean . It's my treat . __eou__  Really ? Can I order anything I want ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Now , have you brought your curriculum vitae with you ? __eou__
 Yes , I am young , and unmarried . It's no problem for me to travel frequently . __eou__  OK . You are good . Hope to see you next time . I'll call you if you get picked for next test . __eou__
 OK , we should get them ready this afternoon . __eou__  One more thing , have you got all people's phone numbers ? __eou__
 Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 No , there ’ s no need . __eou__  Can I print it ? __eou__
 I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now . __eou__  Can I try later then ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . __eou__  Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ? __eou__
 Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? __eou__  I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? __eou__
 Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__  Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? __eou__
 No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . __eou__  What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  Now what can I do for you ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs.Vale ? __eou__
 Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Oh , Candida Fawcett . __eou__  Oh , yes . Arm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ? __eou__
 Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out . __eou__  Oh . This is Paul . When will he be back ? __eou__
 Yes , certainly . __eou__  Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon . __eou__
 All right . I'll tell him when he comes back . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 OK , I'll have Mr.Baker call you as soon as he comes back . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long . __eou__  How long do you think she'll be ? __eou__
 Yes , certainly . __eou__  Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ? __eou__
 Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 I know it . WebTracker is playing for keeps . They'll go for our jugular if we give them the chance . __eou__  This is awkward , I know . I know you're upset . But in two weeks you'll be thanking me . __eou__
 I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now . __eou__  Can I try later then ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . __eou__  Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ? __eou__
 Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? __eou__  I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? __eou__
 Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__  Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  Now what can I do for you ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs.Vale ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Good luck to you . __eou__
 Go ahead . It ’ s OK with me . __eou__  One more thing . Would you give me a ten-dollar raise ? __eou__
 Sure , Emily . We haven't done that in a while . __eou__  Yeah ... actually , we haven't hung out at all recently . You seem sort of under the weather . Is there something going on ? __eou__
 With invoking ? No , thanks . __eou__  I'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building . __eou__
 I'm not interested , Zina . __eou__  Don't play hard to get . The pay is good . You'd be working with Elvin again . __eou__
 I don't think so . __eou__  Elvin doesn't hold a grudge , if that's what you're worried about . __eou__
 Sure ... __eou__  Ok ... I'm just going to lay it all out on the table , What do you think of Vincent's management style ? __eou__
 Good . I'll take care of it . __eou__  Wait a second , Vince . You know what ? Why don't you let me handle it ? __eou__
 I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy . __eou__  What about your accounts ? __eou__
 I'm sorry . I know you feel betrayed . __eou__  So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker ? __eou__
 I can't do that , Zina . You know I can't . __eou__  Bull . I're done my research . I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options . __eou__
 Oh . all right I'll read it soon . __eou__  Excuse me for taking your time . __eou__
 I promise I will . __eou__  You'd better . __eou__
 I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long . __eou__  How long do you think she'll be ? __eou__
 Yes , certainly . __eou__  Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ? __eou__
 Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Well , unfortunately I have got something to do this weekend . But let me see ... __eou__  Oh , I'm sorry.However , if you could help me out , I'll double the pay for the hours worked . __eou__
 Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . __eou__  No.Come here right now . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  What's the matter ? __eou__
 I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . __eou__  It's unfair . __eou__
 OK . I need to think about that for a while . __eou__  All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day . __eou__
 I'm very sorry . But Mr.stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away . __eou__  How about Friday afternoon ? __eou__
 This is he speaking . __eou__  Oh , how do you do , Mr.Zhang ? This is Mary speaking , I have a present for you from Wu of Beijing . __eou__
 Great . Then I'll be at your hotel at two . __eou__  All Right . __eou__
 All Right . __eou__  How could I get there ? __eou__
 I'll do that , Mr.Zhang , See you tomorrow . __eou__  See you ! __eou__
 Right . I ’ ll see you later . __eou__  See you later . __eou__
 Come in , please . __eou__  I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . __eou__
 I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time.If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . __eou__  I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . __eou__
 Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . __eou__  Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . __eou__
 Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday . __eou__  Have you had any experience as a guide ? __eou__
 Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ? __eou__  I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? __eou__
 Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__  Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff.and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  Mary , I'd like you to meet Richard , Our new executive in the marketing . __eou__
 Sure , if you've got any problem you can ask me . __eou__  Thank you.It ' s very kind of you . __eou__
 OK , I'll take it . __eou__  Fine.Please fill out the application form . __eou__
 I'm not good at sports , I have never played tennis , and I know I would be terrible . __eou__  You should try it.It ' s a great game . Come on , let me help you . I'm a good player , and a good teacher , too.What do you say ? __eou__
 OK , but don't say I didn't warn you . __eou__  That was a pretty good shot , Mary . __eou__
 Sure we can . You know , we've been in this line for more than twenty years . __eou__  So , Ms . Thou , we're a newly-established company , but we have wide connections with wholesalers and retailers all over America . __eou__
 I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . __eou__  OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you.However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . __eou__
 Yes , I would . __eou__  Now this is our office block . We have all the administrative departments Sales , Accounting , Personnel , Market Research and so on . __eou__
 Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! __eou__  What would you suggest ? __eou__
 Of course . We both experienced a good cooperation . __eou__  We do think so . __eou__
 Yes . I promise it will not happen again . __eou__  We look forward to your settlement at an early date . __eou__
 That's nice . __eou__  We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings . __eou__
 Yes , I would like to . __eou__  This is our office block . We have all the administrative department here , Sales , Accounts , Personnel , Market Research and so on . __eou__
 OK . Let me see . __eou__  Do you have any different ideas ? __eou__
 I am sure we do have . __eou__  So our evenings will be quite full then ? __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . I ’ ll see you tomorrow at 2 00 . __eou__
 This is Kevin . __eou__  My name is Joan Harris . I ’ m calling from St . Johns Hospital . Are you still interested in a job as a service technician ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . I ’ ll be there on time . __eou__  Excellent . I ’ ll see you on Thursday at 9 30 . __eou__
 It's our pleasure . __eou__  Our hope is to establish mutual beneficial trading relations between us . __eou__
 Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__  I've heard that the company is very strict with its staff.Is that true ? __eou__
 You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic . __eou__  Good luck ! __eou__
 B :: Thank you . __eou__  A :: So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years , ready for change ? __eou__
 Thank you , that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it . __eou__  Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called ” Wild Things ” ? ! __eou__
 It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But now it ’ s the evening rush . __eou__  It ’ s hard to commute a long way . __eou__
 Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . __eou__  There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . __eou__
 I used to hold a similar job for six years . __eou__  So you're quite confident in your experience and skill __eou__
 Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are . __eou__  I have to see the dentist . We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . So if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . If there is something urgent , tell them I will be back in two hours . __eou__
 No problem . Good luck . __eou__  Yes , I will need it . Thanks . __eou__
 Thanks , Vivian . __eou__  No problem at all . Welcome . __eou__
 Ok . __eou__  I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? __eou__
 I apologize . This should not have to be this way . __eou__  Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . __eou__
 All right , I can do that , and as soon as we finish this , we can both work on my problem . __eou__  That works for me . __eou__
 I agree . __eou__  Fine , but before you agree , don't you need to know what you're agreeing to ? __eou__
 I don't see a problem . __eou__  Good ! Do you have any questions ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Can I get you something , coffee , tea ? __eou__
 That'll be fine . __eou__  Then I will see you in my office at ten Wednesday morning . __eou__
 Yes , of course.When ? __eou__  Will you be free this afternoon , say from 3 to 4 ? __eou__
 I'm afraid I won't be free next week . __eou__  It's a shame.Will this afternoon be all right ? But I can only spare you an hour and a half today , from four o'clock . __eou__
 This is he . __eou__  Dr Cook won't be able to see you at the time suggested.Could you make it a quarter to two ? __eou__
 That would be great ! I hate working with computers ! __eou__  Year ! They are unreliable sometimes . __eou__
 I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . __eou__  Why don't you take a few days off ? __eou__
 I appreciate your help . __eou__  Would you like to have a seat over there ? It'll just be a minute . And can I have your name ? __eou__
 I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment . __eou__  Do you know when he will be back ? __eou__
 Great , okay . " Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine " . __eou__  That's great ... __eou__
 Oops , okay . You are right . Then I can just end with " All the best , Tracy " . __eou__  Mmmm , maybe , but I'd play it safe and just finish with " Yours Sincerely " . That's more professional . __eou__
 That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . __eou__  The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . __eou__
 Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you . __eou__  Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ’ ll show you to her office , right this way . __eou__
 Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__  Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? __eou__
 Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . __eou__  No . Come here right now . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  What's the matter ? __eou__
 I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? __eou__  I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . __eou__
 Come in , please . __eou__  I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . __eou__
 I expect to work hard , madam . __eou__  Do you mind going on frequent business trips ? __eou__
 Thank you , Miss Kelly . __eou__  What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ? __eou__
 Yes , I would . __eou__  Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? __eou__
 Yes , I'd like to give it a try . __eou__  All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office . __eou__
 Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . __eou__  Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . __eou__
 Yes , I can adjust to anything . __eou__  That's good . __eou__
 That sounds reasonable . __eou__  Do I have paid vacation ? __eou__
 That sounds fine . __eou__  The salary will be deposited into the bank on the 15th every month . Your salary will be raised every year in October , depending on your performance . __eou__
 That would be great . __eou__  When do you want it delivered ? __eou__
 We can have it to you at that time . __eou__  That's not a problem ? __eou__
 Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ? __eou__  Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years . __eou__
 A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time . __eou__  I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade . __eou__
 Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir ! __eou__  Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ? __eou__
 That ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , so we have plenty of time to get it done . __eou__  Some next week on , we should be in less of a rush . __eou__
 Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__  I've heard that the company is very strict with its staff . Is that true ? __eou__
 It will be expensive to do outside the campus . Perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship . __eou__  We could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets . __eou__
 Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . __eou__  How often do you have meetings ? __eou__
 I sure can . __eou__  Great . See you then . __eou__
 Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . __eou__  The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . __eou__
 Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time . __eou__  One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ? __eou__
 Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll take care of it . __eou__  Great work . I ’ m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday . __eou__
 All right I'll read it soon . __eou__  Excuse me for taking your time . __eou__
 Mike , you're late again . __eou__  I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I __eou__
 I promise I will . __eou__  You'd better . __eou__
We have the orientation this afternoon . __eou__  What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? __eou__
 That will be very nice . You're too kind . __eou__  I've already made a hotel reservation for you , let's go to the hotel first and drop off your things . Then , I'd like to have a drink so that we can get better acquainted . I've booked a table at an exclusive restaurant downtown . Afterwards , I've made arrangements to take you to see the city lights . Seattle ’ s nightlife can be really quite exciting . How does that schedule sound to you ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  My pleasure , I hope your visit to Beijing is very enjoyable ! __eou__
 Yes , sir ... __eou__  This should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon.Are you ready ? __eou__
 Yes , sir.Go ahead . __eou__  Attention all staff ... Effective immediately , all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos.The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited . __eou__
 Yes , my name is Max Richards . May I please speak to George Nelson ? I have already called several times . It seems I always catch him out of the office . __eou__  Oh , I'm sorry . Mr . Nelson is away at the moment . I'm sorry that you keep missing him while he is out of the office . Would you like to leave a message ? __eou__
 Certainly . Mr . Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning . His schedule is very unpredictable at times , so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging . __eou__  Can I leave a message for him please ? __eou__
 Of course , can you leave your name and number ? I'm sure Mr . Nelson will return your call as soon as he is able . __eou__  My name is Max Richards , my phone number is 898-3423 . Could you ask him to call me back as soon as he gets back , please ? I have a rather timely matter to discuss with him . __eou__
 Ok . __eou__  I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? __eou__
 It is ok with me . So I will be arriving at your office around two fifteen PM . __eou__  Yes , there is . See you then . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? __eou__
 I will call them this afternoon , thanks . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . __eou__
 Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity . __eou__  Ok , I see . Good luck to you . You have my number . Call me when you change your mind . I can send you more detailed information about company and jobs you might be interested in if you give me your private e-mail address . __eou__
 Well , I will text to you . Thank you , bye for now . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . Bye . __eou__
 Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time . __eou__  Ok , see you then , bye . __eou__
 Sure , just send me through internal mail . __eou__  Thanks , Vivian . __eou__
 Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are . __eou__  I have to see the dentist . We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . So if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . If there is something urgent , tell them I will be back in two hours . __eou__
 No problem . Good luck . __eou__  Yes , I will need it . Thanks . __eou__
Listen , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . __eou__  I know , but I am really sick . __eou__
 I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . __eou__  This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . __eou__
 Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . __eou__  Ok , good luck to you . __eou__
 Sorry , he is out . __eou__  What time do you expect him back then ? __eou__
 No , thanks . I will call back later . __eou__  That ’ s fine . Please call again later . __eou__
 Yes . I ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 . __eou__  Perfect . Our offer remains open for 3 days . __eou__
 Certainly , I ’ ll make an appointment for you with Mr . Jordan of the Egypt National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import and Export Corporation . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 It ’ s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory . __eou__  Let us know when you are free . We ’ ll arrange the tour for you . __eou__
 That ’ ll be most helpful . __eou__  That is our office block . We have all the administrative depart - ments there . Down there is the research and development section . __eou__
 Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . __eou__  What about the commission ? From European suppliers I usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports . It ’ s the general practice . __eou__
 Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . __eou__  So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? __eou__
 I propose we accept the minutes . __eou__  Good . Do I have a second ? __eou__
 Go ahead , please . __eou__  How long is my paid vacation every year ? __eou__
 Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days . __eou__  Ok , thank you for your time and patience . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? __eou__
 Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . __eou__  Thank you for telling me that . __eou__
 I got it . __eou__  Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . __eou__
 Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . __eou__  Would you please ask when he will be free ? __eou__
 He is at the warehouse this morning . __eou__  What time do you expect him back ? __eou__
 Unfortunately , he has left for the day . __eou__  I hate to trouble of you . But it is urgent . Please leave this message into him __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . __eou__
 Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
 Yes , Sir . __eou__  These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . __eou__
 That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time . __eou__  We must find some time to read report . __eou__
 That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . __eou__  See you . __eou__
 I got it . Thank you so much . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 Done . Here is my paper . __eou__  Everybody attention . I would like to make sure you all know the process . The interview consists of three parts . One , all of the interviewees will answer the question there and lasts for maximum one hour . Two , we will take a 30 - minute ’ s break . After the break , we all come back to this office and I will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round . In which , you have a small interview with your future manager . __eou__
 Of course not , I appreciate that . __eou__  Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment . __eou__  John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion . __eou__
 Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . __eou__  Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . __eou__
 Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . __eou__  You've earned it . __eou__
 Yes , I have decided to work with your company . __eou__  Good news for us . When can you start to work ? __eou__
 No problem . Thank you for calling me . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? __eou__  Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . __eou__
 Ok , thank you . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . Feel free to ask me any time you need help . __eou__
 Yeah , what's the matter now ? We've had so much trouble with this case already . Don't tell me there's more bad news . __eou__  Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . __eou__
 No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? __eou__  We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . __eou__
 No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 . __eou__  Hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... Oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . That will definitely add to your cost on this project ... __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? __eou__
 That would be very nice . Thank you . __eou__  Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared __eou__
 Of course not , I appreciate that . __eou__  Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? __eou__
 Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . __eou__  Would you please ask when he will be free ? __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? __eou__
 I will call them this afternoon , thanks . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . __eou__
 Sure , here it is ... __eou__  Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . As we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details . __eou__
 Sure , what I can do for you ? __eou__  I'm try to write a letter to one of our clients , But I just don't know exactly what to say , I don't even know how to get started , I know I should write dear Mr . Mrs . or Ms . , but the problem is I don't know the name of contact person . __eou__
 Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . __eou__  Thank you for telling me that . __eou__
 I got it . __eou__  Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Is there the correct billing address ? __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  I'm sorry , Ms.Jenkins is away from her desk.She has already left for lunch.Would you like to leave a message for her ? __eou__
 You don't have to do that ... __eou__  I insist . I really appreciate you taking time to work with me in . What is your favorite fast food ? I'll cater to your taste . __eou__
 No problem . I have you appointment changed from tomorrow morning to tomorrow afternoon at one fifteen . __eou__  Wonderful . Thanks very much . __eou__
 Today , I am busy all day long . __eou__  Shall I see you on Friday morning ? __eou__
 That ’ s not good for me at all . It ’ ll have to be another time . __eou__  We must find some time to read report . __eou__
 Yes , Sir . __eou__  These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . __eou__
 Yes , I do . I like traveling very much . __eou__  Are you willing to work for extra hours ? __eou__
 Of course , I'll try my best.When can I start working ? __eou__  What about next Monday ? __eou__
 Great.Let ' s start next week.Thank you , ma'am . __eou__  Well , see you next monday . __eou__
 Sure . No problem . __eou__  Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? __eou__
 Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ? __eou__  Sure , Merton Financial Advisors . __eou__
 Sorry , I can ’ t . I ’ m busy . __eou__  What are you doing ? __eou__
 Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__  Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . __eou__
 No problem , I ’ ll take those . Sir , these coupons expired yesterday . __eou__  Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway . __eou__
 That ’ s no problem . __eou__  Do you have any other questions ? __eou__
 Yes , please . My telephone number is 2974-5328 , and you can call me at any time in the daytime . __eou__  We will get in touch with you by the end of next week . __eou__
 Well , thank you for your time and consideration again . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 Sure , it ’ s Josh O ’ Neil . __eou__  Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background . __eou__
 OK , please . __eou__  What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ? __eou__
 Yes , please tell her I stopped by . __eou__  And your name , please ? __eou__
 Yes , thank you . __eou__  I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University . Will you please tell me something about your related courses ? __eou__
 That's a little less than I expected . But to me , the most important thing is the job and the people I will work with . Moreover , I am sure I will get a raise quickly depending on my background and experience . __eou__  That sounds very reasonable . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  From Video TV . __eou__
 Extension 162 . Okay , Mr . Suzuki . I'll give him the message . __eou__  Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
 Ah , never mind , please . __eou__  Can you tell me how old you are ? __eou__
 It's me . What can I do for you ? __eou__  Nice to meet you , Mrs . Smith . I'm coming here for an interview by appointment . __eou__
 Yes , please . __eou__  How are you doing , Madam ? My name is During . I am coming to your company for an interview as requested . __eou__
 Fine , thank you for coming . Mr . Wu , Please take a seat . I am Anne Smith , the assistant manager . __eou__  Nice to see you , Mrs . Smith . __eou__
 Yes . Everything's all set . __eou__  I'd like to bring Mr . Huang and Ms . Sun with me . __eou__
 We're supposed to be meeting alone . __eou__  I know , but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion . __eou__
 Oh , I see . __eou__  Yeah , just fill out this form and choose a password . The computer will do the rest . __eou__
 Oh , that would be too small . __eou__  With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . __eou__
 I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . __eou__  You have some doubts about our products , I understand . __eou__
 Thanks . __eou__  For detailed information , however , you should read a history book . __eou__
 Yes , speaking . __eou__  Good morning , Mr . Wilson . I ’ m calling to confirm the date of the next interview program . __eou__
 Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__  Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . __eou__
 I'm not sure if that would be wise . __eou__  Then what is your opinion ? __eou__
 I'm afraid ... __eou__  All right , all right . He'll get them as soon as possible . __eou__
 I would if I could . __eou__  Why can't you ? __eou__
 All right , I ’ ll leave her the message , Mary . Thanks for calling . __eou__  Thank you . Bye . __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry , Nigel . I'm rushing to a meet right now . __eou__  Sure , no problem . Can we fix a time to talk later ? __eou__
 Yes . Here it is . __eou__  Can you briefly tell me about one of your designs ? __eou__
 I'm sorry Mrs wang , but Mrs Fu is not in at the moment . __eou__  When will he come back , do you know ? __eou__
 Of course . __eou__  Please ask him to give me a call as soon as he return . he has my number . __eou__
 Ok , Mrs wang . I'll do that . __eou__  thank you . goodbye . __eou__
 Sure , go ahead . __eou__  Could you tell me where the canteen is ? __eou__
 Oh , I don't want to trouble you . __eou__  It's fine . I was heading there anyway . __eou__
 That would be great ! I hate working with computers ! __eou__  Year ! They are unreliable sometimes . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Can I get you something , coffee , tea ? __eou__
 That's what I understand . __eou__  You'll be covered by our medical plan while on duty.Since you'll be middle management , you're expected to be available up to 1.5 hours past normal working hours.Any approved time over that will be paid at time and a half , which you can take as salary or time off . __eou__
 Exactly my understanding . __eou__  A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company.Any extended illness will be covered by insurance.Have you read the other terms of the contract ? __eou__
 That's acceptable . __eou__  Good.Now , if you'll just sign here , you can start work in 3 days . __eou__
 I am sorry , but I don't have one with me right now . __eou__  In that case , just tell me your phone number . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  What would you like , tea or coffee ? __eou__
 Your desire coincides with ours . __eou__  Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to Bank of Hong Kong , or to our local Chamber of Commerce or inquiry agencies . __eou__
 We ’ ll then make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be conducted between us . __eou__  So do I . __eou__
 I'm not sure I can't agree , dan __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 Ditto , it doesn't look too expensive either . __eou__  That's right , Nigel . I think we can keep cost down . __eou__
 As a rule we don't allow any commission . But if the order is sizable one , we will consider it . __eou__  You see I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even 2 or 3 % would help . __eou__
 Ok , I am coming . __eou__  Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ? __eou__
 No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . __eou__  All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments . __eou__
 Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ? __eou__  Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list . __eou__
 All right . __eou__  The manager will come to see you in a few minutes . __eou__
 The manager will come to see you in a few minutes . __eou__  Thanks a lot , Mrs . White . __eou__
 Oh , that's no problem . Just give me a moment , and I can check.Judy Liao . Let's see ... Yes , here it is . Judy Liao . We have received your resume . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Thank you . Goodbye . __eou__
 All right , then . We'll get in touch with you within a week . Thank you for coming today , Mr . Sun . __eou__  Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
 Okay , what should I do ? __eou__  Well , it isn't at this office . It's over at the Dayton Street office.Have you been there before ? __eou__
 Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check . __eou__  Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ? __eou__
 Alright . __eou__  He's here on Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Fridays . What day did you want to see him ? __eou__
 Yes . My name is Laura Wills . __eou__  Alright . I have you down for ten AM this Friday . __eou__
 No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . __eou__  So , you're a serious coffee drinker . __eou__
 Well . __eou__  I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . __eou__
 Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . __eou__  I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . __eou__
 I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . __eou__  Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . __eou__
 thank you for help.good bye . __eou__  You are welcome , goodbye . __eou__
 I know . But hard work pays off , you know . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 I can do the work of shop assistant and I worked part time in a small department store during my summer vocation last year . __eou__  So now do you want a full-time job or part-time job ? __eou__
 I think I can . I have been learning English for almost 5 years and especially I am fluent at speaking English.Also , I have made some foreigners friends during the experience of learning English . __eou__  That is fine . I think you have the qualifications needed for the job , so I will let you have the job.Does the work schedule suit you ? __eou__
 It quite suits me . I am free in the evening these days , I will have no difficulty starting at five pm . __eou__  Good.There is only thing to be settled.Ten RIB an hour is the maximum we can pay you.Is the rate of pay acceptable to you ? __eou__
 Sure.You will get more if you can invite more customers with your good service . __eou__  I see . I will try my best to do the job well . __eou__
 Ok.Let ' s make is next Monday . I n the end , you need to fill out the application form . __eou__  Thank you for your kindness , ma'am . See you next Monday . __eou__
 Sorry , he's out . __eou__  What time you suspect back them ? __eou__
 No , thanks . I'll call back later . __eou__  That's fine.please call again later . __eou__
 I am afraid not , but I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes . __eou__  Oh , that's very kind of you . Thank you very much . I've got to go . __eou__
 Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead . __eou__  Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush . __eou__
 I'd like to , but the photocopier is out of order . __eou__  Then use the xerox machine . __eou__
 It broke down one year ago . __eou__  Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk . __eou__
 All right . See you later . __eou__  After a while . __eou__
 I don't mind that . __eou__  I think I will give you a 3 months ’ trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed . __eou__
 Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye ! __eou__  Goodbye ! __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 sure , have a seat . __eou__  thanks . __eou__
 I'm sorry , he's out at the moment . __eou__  When do you expect him back ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . __eou__  Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ? __eou__
 I ’ m kind of useless in that area , but I ’ ll take a look at it . __eou__  Ah , thanks . __eou__
 Thank you , sir . I'll tell him you called . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 ok . __eou__  ... sorry , her line is busy at the moment . Can I take a message ? __eou__
 ok , Nathaniel . I'll have Ms . Collins call you back sometime tonight before 6 pm . __eou__  thank you ! __eou__
 Yes , Mr . Michael ? __eou__  You have to listen to what the client asks for . What you have just shown me is not at all in line with the client ’ s wishes . __eou__
 Thanks . I can wait here . __eou__  Well , it may take some time . Mr . Emory ’ s at a meeting at the moment . It would probably be more comfortable over there . __eou__
 Why , Christine ? I think the one we have is fine . __eou__  For the amount of work we do on the computer these days , the one we ’ re using is just too weak . We really need a higher model . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , Jeff . Please don ’ t interrupt me right now . I ’ m in the middle of a conversation . __eou__  Oh , I ’ m sorry , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll come back later . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today . __eou__  I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up . __eou__
 I was supposed to do that ? I thought Sharon was responsible for that . __eou__  No , Liz . I asked you specifically . Don ’ t you remember ? __eou__
 I agree , Toni . I think the biggest problem we ’ re facing is how to bring it in under budget . __eou__  That ’ s true . But even beyond that , there ’ s the question of meeting the deadlines they ’ Ve set . __eou__
 I know , Mr . Douglas . But I am really sick . __eou__  Well , I want a note from the doctor on this one . And , to be honest , if this continues , we may not be able to employ you here . __eou__
 Oh , Kate ! I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind ! __eou__  That ’ s okay , Martin . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I ’ d appreciate it . __eou__
 Certainly , Mr . Emory . What can I do for you ? __eou__  I need you to take a look at these samples . I think there are a few problems . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , Janet . I left it at home . I ’ ll bring it back in the morning . __eou__  Mark , I told you yesterday afternoon that I would be using that file today . __eou__
 That ’ s going to take a while to put together , Paul . __eou__  The sooner , the better , Sandy . I don ’ t think he ’ ll sign anything till he ’ s got that in his hands . __eou__
 Sure , Stacy . Let me just grab my coat . __eou__  Thanks . I appreciate the hand . I ’ d have to make two or three trips on my own . __eou__
 Sure . The twenty-ninth is out . I ’ ll be out of the office all day at a seminar . Either the twenty-eighth or the thirtieth is fine . __eou__  Well , why don ’ t we make it the thirtieth ? We can set it up from three to five . That way , everybody can just go home afterwards . __eou__
 I know . I ’ m just waiting for confirmation on one of them . I can get them to you by tomorrow morning . __eou__  Yeah ? All right . Thanks , Susan . __eou__
 I ’ m in a bit of a hurry , Louise . Can it wait ? __eou__  I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in . __eou__
 Yeah . I think that would be a good idea . I ’ m really in the dark on everything . __eou__  Fine . Let ’ s meet this afternoon . I ’ ll draw you a better picture of the situation . __eou__
 Sure , Sherry . Sorry to have kept you waiting . If you hadn ’ t told me , I probably would have just forgotten all about them . __eou__  That ’ s my job , sir . Just one more signature here , please . __eou__
 Certainly , Mr . Williams . Just one moment , please . __eou__  Thanks , Karen . __eou__
 I sure can . __eou__  Great . See you then . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but Mr.Tomas left here just a few minutes ago . __eou__  I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line was busy . Will he be back soon ? __eou__
 Wrong number ? Are you sure ? I called yesterday and she was there . __eou__  I'm sure you have the wrong number . This one has been my number for more than 20 years . __eou__
 I'm sorry , he is not here at the moment . He has gone to the International Business Center . __eou__  When do you expect him back ? __eou__
 Seeing as next month is our slow season , that should not be a problem . __eou__  Great . I will make my reservations as necessary . __eou__
 Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off . __eou__  I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them . __eou__
 Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking __eou__  That sounds great . Do you accept checks ? __eou__
 Not at all . Go right ahead . __eou__  What ’ s this sir ? __eou__
 I see . I guess you can tell I don ’ t travel much . __eou__  ( later ) Here ’ s your card , sir . You ’ re all checked in . let me just tell you about a few of our services . We have free breakfast in the lounge from 7:00- 9:00 . You call the receptionist to arrange __eou__
 A bottle of glue . __eou__  And I want a large box of chalk , too . __eou__
 No , thank you . __eou__  Is that all ? __eou__
 Let me see ... Wednesday morning . Yes , I am booked solid all morning . What ’ s up ? __eou__  I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . I ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . It has a lot of complicated form __eou__
 Ooh . Sorry , that ’ s not good for me . I am tied up all day Friday . We ’ ll have to do it next week . I am wide open then . __eou__  OK . Shall we say next week , on Tuesday at 2:30 ? __eou__
 Yes , it ’ s confirmed for here in our office . __eou__  Is your address still 1150 Lake Road ? __eou__
 That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm . __eou__  Great . Talk to you then . __eou__
 OK Mr . Lee . I have you booked on flight 513 leaving on the 5th at 11:00 pm and arriving in New York on the 6th at 6 __eou__  Will there be any layovers ? __eou__
 Good morning . Thank you . __eou__  I see that you have some impressive writing experience . __eou__
 OK . Let me send a memo around . __eou__  Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back . __eou__
 Yes , I do . I ’ d prefer you didn ’ t . The AC ( air-conditioning ) is also on . __eou__  Can I just turn off the AC for now and open the window and smoke indoors ? __eou__
 It ’ s very hot and that ’ s why I ’ d like to smoke inside . __eou__  Though the AC has the air-purifying function . I ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke . Are you okay with that ? __eou__
 Ok . Ask away . __eou__  first , I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave . __eou__
 we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract . __eou__  how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? __eou__
 I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . __eou__  can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? __eou__
 of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally . __eou__  thanks . I appreciate that . __eou__
 that will be fine . __eou__  ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 . See you then . __eou__
 absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . __eou__  good . How about your cover letter ? __eou__
 sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention . __eou__  yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . __eou__
 I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . __eou__  Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . __eou__
 That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . __eou__  The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . __eou__
 sure . I ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . __eou__  thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at . __eou__
 that ’ s an excellent suggestion . I can easily do it on the computer . __eou__  why don ’ t you use a different font the headings ? They ’ ll be more distinct . __eou__
 I ’ ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ? __eou__  I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly . __eou__
 don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear . __eou__  that ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . __eou__
 that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted . __eou__  may I make a suggestion ? __eou__
 sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . __eou__  Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? If they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . You won ’ t get credit for ide __eou__
 I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea . __eou__  go on . Take a chance . You could just hint at your idea . The client should be smart enough to take a hint . __eou__
 Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . __eou__  The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . __eou__
 Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . __eou__  Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? __eou__
 Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . __eou__  How often do you have meetings ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together . __eou__  You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ? __eou__
 That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . __eou__  I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . __eou__
 I can ’ t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ? What ’ s it about ? __eou__  Well , I ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you , if that ’ s all right . __eou__
 Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you . __eou__  Not at all , Susan . Just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he ’ s finished with it __eou__
 OK , I am ready to think of other things . __eou__  You need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . You'll do great ! __eou__
 I need to stay in the area because of my family . __eou__  How much do you need to make per year ? __eou__
 Yes , I will bring my plans with me to the meeting . __eou__  Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ? __eou__
 Yes , I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting . __eou__  Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee ? __eou__
 Oh , umm , no thanks . __eou__  I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines . __eou__
 No , I am ok , really . __eou__  Come on man ! I even got dope and acid ! Try some ! __eou__
 Sounds good ! Let ’ s see , I want . __eou__  Yeah ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  What's your name ? __eou__
 Yes . I ’ ll do it tomorrow . __eou__  And Lisa . __eou__
 No , I have no idea what you are talking about . __eou__  It's easy , just write in the hours , total it , sign it , and put it in the box . __eou__
 Yes , I can do that . __eou__  Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week . Do you know how to use military time ? __eou__
 Yes , I understand how to do this . __eou__  After you total your hours , make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor . __eou__
 That was easy ! __eou__  Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on . __eou__
 Yes , I understand what to do . __eou__  You fill in the hours and total them for the week . Have you ever used a 24 hour clock ? __eou__
 I will be prepared to do my presentation . __eou__  Who would you like to see there ? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee ? __eou__
 No , nothing changed . __eou__  When you dial 9 and hear the tone change it means you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? __eou__
 OK , it won't happen again . __eou__  All right , please take this message and call this client . __eou__
 OK , no problem . __eou__  Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board ? __eou__
 I will try . My apologies . __eou__  I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting . __eou__
 Sure , I'll sit right here . __eou__  Wonderful , does anyone have any questions about this project ? __eou__
 I didn't do anything . __eou__  We've found some heroin at your house . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  What's your name ? __eou__
 Yes , I'll work on it . __eou__  Thank you , have a seat . We are working on the new project __eou__
 Great ! Fill me in . __eou__  Let's take a look at the Campbell Project . __eou__
 I could do some typing for you . __eou__  That is very kind of you to offer to do that . Can you start with the pages on the table ? __eou__
 Sure I will get to do that right now . __eou__  I like your positive attitude . How many years have you been employed here ? __eou__
 I'm not sure . Let me think about it . __eou__  OK . I will mention how great you were about helping me today . I appreciate your help . __eou__
 I like xeroxing . __eou__  Thank you ! There are papers on the table to start with . __eou__
 OK , I will get right to that . __eou__  I really appreciate the help . How many years have you been with the company ? __eou__
 I'd like to , but I am very busy . __eou__  I'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for special projects in the future . Thanks for the help ! __eou__
 I can do either one . __eou__  Good . That would be very helpful . Can you start with those pages over there ? __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  Thank you very much ! How long have you been working here ? __eou__
 Yes , I would love to work on a special project ! __eou__  Well then , I'll keep you in the loop . Thank you for your help today . __eou__
 Yes , I like working like that . __eou__  We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ? __eou__
 Yes , I can be there . __eou__  Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful . __eou__
 OK , I will send the information to you . __eou__  Well then , thanks for your help . Have a great day ! __eou__
 Most of the time that is what I prefer . __eou__  We start on Monday . Can you be there ? __eou__
 I am not sure yet . __eou__  I need your background information before the meeting . __eou__
 I will do that . __eou__  I'll enjoy working with you . Have a great day ! __eou__
 That is OK sometimes . __eou__  Our first meeting is next Monday . Could you meet with us at that time ? __eou__
 No , I can't be there . __eou__  Please send me your background information before the meeting so I can look at it . __eou__
 I can send that information to you . __eou__  OK . I look forward to working with you . Enjoy your week ! __eou__
 I can wait a few days for these items . __eou__  Make sure that you have money allocated for these supplies . How much do you have for office supplies ? __eou__
 I am not sure yet . __eou__  When you finish completing the request form , we will order and let you know when the supplies are here . Have a great day ! __eou__
 Well , just finish the request and we will contact you when the supplies come in . Have a good day ! __eou__  You too ! __eou__
 Fine , well just send the form to us and we will let you know as soon as your supplies come in . Have a good day ! __eou__  Thank you ! __eou__
 I think that they are a very formal company . __eou__  What you wear is important . So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing . Need help ? __eou__
 I need a lot of help in this area . __eou__  In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , OK ? __eou__
 Yes , I know what to do . __eou__  Well , in addition , you can schedule an appointment with a job counselor on this list . If you would like to do that , sign here , OK ? __eou__
 Yes , I think that would be great . __eou__  Fine , well the job search tools are all here for you to use . Feel free to look around and use what works best for you . Have fun with it ! __eou__
 I am confused a bit but I am sure that I can figure it out . __eou__  If you make an appointment with a job counselor , they can also provide you with a lot of information . Do you want to see a counselor ? __eou__
 No , I don't think I need to do that . __eou__  Well , you know that this job center is here for your use , so help yourself . Good luck ! __eou__
 We offer full tuition reimbursement for job related classes . __eou__  Where is the benefits office ? __eou__
 I am open to relocating . __eou__  What are your annual salary requirements ? __eou__
 You are in the right place . Please come on in ! __eou__  It ’ s been a long time since I ’ Ve had to look for work and put a resume together . __eou__
 Sure . I have it right here . 232-2453 . If that one doesn ’ t work , try 232-2456 . __eou__  Okay – that ’ s 232-2453 , or 232-2456 . __eou__
 Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date . __eou__  Will my paycheck come right away now ? __eou__
 I think that I will mail it in right away when I get it next time , so I won ’ t be late . __eou__  You can ’ t mail it in early because you don ’ t know , in advance , how much you will be working . __eou__
 I would be happy to answer any questions you might have . __eou__  My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week . __eou__
 I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem . __eou__  You can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it ! __eou__
 Certainly , Miss Parker , Let me get my book . My secretary ’ s out and I can ’ t keep anything straight ! __eou__  I understand . Would you like me to call you back ? __eou__
 All right . That ’ ll be fine . Can you put together a rough idea of the kind of money I ’ ll have available for the next year ? __eou__  Certainly . I ’ Ve already worked out a general budget for all the departments . __eou__
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . I forgot about those completely . I ’ ll bring them by your office . __eou__  Okay . The sooner the better . __eou__
 Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ’ Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow . __eou__  I ’ d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ’ ll need me to stay ? __eou__
 That ’ s fine . I can make that . __eou__  All right , then . I ’ ll see you at noon on Wednesday . __eou__
 Certainly , Mr . Knight . When would you like to meet with him ? __eou__  Can you see what his schedule is like on Wednesday ? __eou__
 No problem . I ’ Ve got a really light week . Anytime ’ s fine by me . __eou__  Well , let ’ s plan to get together next Monday afternoon , around three ? __eou__
 Sure . What ’ s it about ? __eou__  He wants to go over the bonuses for this year . He ’ ll need to meet with Mr . Winthrop and Ms . Montgomery . Can you set it up for me ? __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ’ t let it happen again . __eou__  That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! __eou__
 I ’ d be glad to help . __eou__  How much do you charge ? __eou__
 That ’ s highway robbery . __eou__  I don ’ t know what to tell you . __eou__
 That ’ s wonderful . Thank you . __eou__  Can I see your ID , please ? __eou__
 Here you go . __eou__  I have your ballot card right here . __eou__
 I'm here to help . Tell me your questions and I'll do my best to answer them . __eou__  What if I require a loan for a short period of time ? __eou__
 That's no problem ; I can take care of that for you . __eou__  I need to have a credit check done for my company . __eou__
 If it's this kind of consultancy service , I'll have to direct you to another department , I'm afraid . __eou__  That's no problem . Do you offer any other consulting services ? __eou__
 I'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting . __eou__  I'll return at about 4:30 pm . See you then . __eou__
 Certainly ... __eou__  OK , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . That means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card . __eou__
 Yes , yes . I've got all of that here . __eou__  And also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number . __eou__
 Check , check and check . __eou__  What's the purpose for this check ? Would you like to know its repayment capacity ? __eou__
 Speaking . __eou__  Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you . __eou__
 Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon . __eou__  What perfect timing ! __eou__
 I did that already , while I was waiting . Also , here's my card . __eou__  Thank you . And you require ... __eou__
 OK ... __eou__  Thank you . Here's your card back and your money . Please double check it for me . __eou__
 Here it is . I usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . __eou__  Yes , it's the same every day during the lunchtime rush . We will be putting in a new ATM in the near future , though . That should help to ease the queues . __eou__
 Fine . Here you go . __eou__  How much would you like to withdraw ? __eou__
 That's fine . __eou__  OK , 200 USD , please . __eou__
 Unfortunately , no , I can't . But our specialist can . Please take a seat and our Mortgage Adviser will come out to see you . __eou__  A specialist ? That's excellent , thanks . __eou__
 I already have an account with you , so it should be pretty straight forward . __eou__  That is good , it should speed things up nicely . __eou__
 Not a problem . We offer a Personal Loan for Studying Abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . Anyone is eligible to apply __eou__  Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? __eou__
 Here it is . __eou__  All right , here is your ballot card . __eou__
 Thanks for telling me . __eou__  You should be excited about your first vote . __eou__
 I ’ m so glad you told me that . __eou__  Good luck on your first election . __eou__
 I guess America is finally maturing . __eou__  I think you have a point . __eou__
 Just one second , and I'll check . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Well , I've always used the Bank Book , but now I have this card . I don't know how to use it in the machine . __eou__  Don't worry ; I can help you with that . I understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving . The first thing we need to do is check the ATM is in service . This one is fine . __eou__
 Oh , it wants me to put in my PIN number . OK , I can do that ... __eou__  And press ' enter ' to confirm , here . Now you need to decide which service you need . __eou__
 Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back ! __eou__  I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ? __eou__
 Welcome to the electronic age ! I can run you through it ; it's what I'm here for . __eou__  Thanks so much . Right , I've put my card in . What now ? __eou__
 Please , go right ahead . __eou__  Could I have your name , please ? And do you know your card number ? __eou__
 I'm Mike Kowalski and my card number is 5211678 44 , but there are some other numbers at the beginning . I'm not sure what they are . __eou__  That should be fine , Mr Kowalski . And your PIN number ? __eou__
 It's 671029 , my birthday . Silly to choose such a simple one , I suppose ! __eou__  That's completely natural . Most of our customers do the same thing . Could you just hold for a moment please ? Thank you . __eou__
 Yes , that's fine . My credit is good ; I banked at my former bank for many years . __eou__  May I ask why you decided to switch your account to us ? __eou__
 OK , Madam . We are here to help . __eou__  I already have some Time Deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . I really don't want to cash those just yet . __eou__
 The procedure is really simple and convenient . All you need to do is fill in this Loan Application form . __eou__  Right ... anything else ? __eou__
 Indeed . I've decided to go for the Petty Consumer Loan . That is , if my credit rating is satisfactory . __eou__  Your credit is fine , Sir . Now , tell me , what is it that you need the loan for ? __eou__
 Certainly , Sir . I'd be happy to . The Personal Pledge Loan is a loan secured by undue certificates , Time Deposits , for example , or Visible Treasury Bonds . __eou__  So , as long as I have one of those , I can apply for a Personal Pledge Loan ? __eou__
 That's correct , Sir . The bank will issue receipt to you and also take care of all the pledged securities . __eou__  Mmmm ... how about the period of repayment ? __eou__
 Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . __eou__  I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan . __eou__
 I can assist you . __eou__  How are you going to help me ? __eou__
 I have it right here . __eou__  Here ’ s your ballot card . __eou__
 I ’ m still shocked that Obama was elected . __eou__  I couldn ’ t believe it , either . __eou__
 I do this every year . __eou__  How ’ d you get that job ? __eou__
 I didn ’ t think of that . __eou__  I know . It ’ ll also help you make more money . __eou__
 That is a good idea . __eou__  You ’ ll make more money that way . __eou__
 That ’ s a great idea . __eou__  That ’ ll help you make more money . __eou__
 Go for it . __eou__  Have you voted yet ? __eou__
 Sure , you can . __eou__  Did you vote today ? __eou__
 Ask away . __eou__  First of all , did you vote today ? __eou__
 All right . __eou__  Do you recognize the suspect ? __eou__
 Okay . __eou__  Is the suspect in this line ? __eou__
 That won't be a problem . __eou__  Look closely at the five men in this line-up . __eou__
 I am looking . __eou__  Do you see the suspect ? __eou__
 I can ’ t afford that . __eou__  That ’ s my rate . __eou__
 I ’ m willing to provide my services . __eou__  What ’ s your rate ? __eou__
 That ’ s too high . __eou__  That ’ s what I charge . __eou__
 I'm just doing my job . __eou__  How much is the ticket for ? __eou__
 It's just a ticket . __eou__  How much is the fine ? __eou__
 I'm not going to be able to do that . __eou__  How much will the fine be ? __eou__
 But all the evidence points to you . __eou__  I am not the guilty party __eou__
 We can work something out . __eou__  I have no problem singing like a canary . __eou__
 I ’ m sure we can work out some kind of deal . __eou__  I ’ ll tell you all you need to know . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe it . __eou__  What are your plans ? __eou__
 That ’ s great . __eou__  What are your plans now that you ’ re getting out ? __eou__
 I ’ m so excited . __eou__  What are you planning on doing now ? __eou__
 You won't have to pay the fine . __eou__  Thank you very much , Your Honor . __eou__
 I ’ d be glad to make a deal with you . __eou__  I am willing to tell you that information . __eou__
 Yes , I know . I regret it very much . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 Yes please . I really am an absolute amateur when it comes to this stuff . __eou__  No problem . First of all , we can provide a business licence . Secondly , Enterprise ID Certificates , Forex registration and ... __eou__
 I understand . To be honest , I'll be glad to get rid of it if it is a fake . __eou__  The machine shows it to be counterfeit . You'll need to fill in this form and I'll give you a receipt to show the money has been confiscated . __eou__
 OK , here you go . __eou__  So , that's everything done for you . Here's your new cheque book , the cheque guarantee will follow in the post in a couple of days . __eou__
 Oh , right , of course . Here you go . __eou__  Here is your RIB , the exchange form and receipt and your passport . Please check the amount . __eou__
 OK , well , I'm going to Europe . I guess 1,000 USD will be sufficient for now . __eou__  OK , I'll process that for you now . __eou__
 Please . Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something ! __eou__  With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly . __eou__
 Here you go . __eou__  Thanks . And of course , could you fill in the exchange form ? __eou__
 Of course , that's no problem at all . __eou__  That's a relief ! I was a little worried about it ; I left England in a bit of a hurry . __eou__
 I have my passport right here , and here are the account details . The name , number ... __eou__  Mr Jurgen , yes , the remittance has been successful . __eou__
 That would be wonderful . __eou__  We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world . They are certainly the most versatile . __eou__
 No problem . __eou__  And how much of your salary would you like ? __eou__
 Why ? They keep going up . __eou__  I have a feeling they're about to go down in a few days . __eou__
 OK ... so it'll come out of my account ? Well , that makes it much easier . __eou__  Anything else you'll be needing today , Sir ? __eou__
 That shouldn't be a problem , Madam . I'm sure we can sort this out for you quickly . __eou__  That would be wonderful . The problem is I don't have an account with you . That is a problem , isn't it ? __eou__
 Thanks for your advice , after going through all of these materials I've decided not to go with my initial choice . __eou__  Of course , Sir . If I could have your details again and your ID , I'll check them and we can go on . __eou__
 Right , here it is . __eou__  Thanks . OK ... your balance is 320,214 RIB . How much do you require today ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available . __eou__  Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB . __eou__
 There you are . As you can see , the maturity isn't up yet . __eou__  You do realise that you must pay a 0.2 % charge for premature cancellation , right ? __eou__
 We can amend it for you as long as your customer agrees to the amendment . __eou__  It's all agreed , here's a letter to prove it . __eou__
 All right . Here you are . __eou__  Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan . __eou__
 All right . Here it is . __eou__  For 1,200 yuan to Nanchang , the commission is 12 yuan . __eou__
 Here you are . Thanks . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 OK , you can take that from my account . I'll fill in the form now . __eou__  Thanks . Yes ... that's all in order . What we will do now is send the L / C amendment to the negotiating bank . As soon as we know anything , we'll contact you . __eou__
 Yes , I've got that here ... __eou__  And your statement reference and the payment amount . Click on next , then ' pay beneficiaries ' . That's it ! All done . __eou__
 Yes , I've got all that here . __eou__  Do you have a copy of the ID card of the person who took care of the legal aspects of this ? The Legal Rep , I mean ? We also need the Loan Certificate as well . Do you have that ? __eou__
 Yeah , sure . Here they are . Take your time going through them , I'm in no hurry . __eou__  There's no problem here , everything's in order . I can transact that for you now . __eou__
 There's no problem here , everything's in order . I can transact that for you now . __eou__  Do I need to pay anything ? Like a handling fee , or something ? __eou__
 Oh , I see . __eou__  Next time , you can get one from the counter over there . Or before you come in , you can download one from our website . It's really easy . __eou__
 Unfortunately , not . __eou__  OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan . __eou__
 I see . You are one of my favourite customers , Mr Brown . I'm more than happy to help . For Comprehensive Credit Granting , IBA will grant a promised quota for you , that is , if you qualify . Of course , your credit record , within you field of trade needs to be up to scratch . __eou__  How long a period will you look at to determine this ? __eou__
 OK , just a moment ... yes , it has arrived . The amount is 51,998 US dollars net , 12 US dollars has been deducted by the intermediary bank . __eou__  That's as it should be . When will it be paid in and credited to our account ? __eou__
 Yes , right here in my brief case . Just a moment , please . __eou__  Thanks . What you need to do now is deposit 100 % of the guaranteed funds of your contract into your account with us . __eou__
 That's done . There is more than enough to cover the contract amount in our account . __eou__  That's great . We will have to charge you 250 RIB for that service , though . Could you please fill in this ? Thanks . __eou__
 Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange . __eou__  Yes , I have known of it . __eou__
 It doesn't matter . __eou__  Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo . __eou__
 Certainly , I'll be very happy to help you . Usually we offer current or fixed accounts for individuals . __eou__  What's the difference between the two ? __eou__
 Good . Everything is done . Here is your deposit book and ID card . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  All right . Just a moment , please . __eou__
 Just pulling up your information now . Yes , some documents arrived for you from Sapporo . __eou__  Oh great ! We've been waiting for those . Is everything alright with them ? __eou__
 Yes , you can . Just wait a moment and I'll do that for you now . __eou__  That's fine , thanks . __eou__
 Yes , you can have multi-accounts on the card , you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits . __eou__  That's wonderful . __eou__
 That's no trouble , Sir . __eou__  I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc . It sounds just perfect for me , as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance . __eou__
 For every transaction you make , a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail , or if you want to be double sure we can do both . __eou__  That's just what I need , sometimes I'm pretty forgetful . __eou__
 That's so simple . I'll come by my local branch later this afternoon and get it set up . Thank you very much , Tina . __eou__  It's a pleasure . Thanks for calling Lincoln Bank . __eou__
 Of course . It's 33234 . That will put you in touch with a Personal Banker . __eou__  And they can deal with everything ? __eou__
 Of course . Financing Link is a value-added service , and can be tailored to suit your requirements . __eou__  So , I can choose exactly what services I require ? That's brilliant . Can I use the card if I'm overseas to withdraw my daily expenses ? __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ? __eou__
 Of course , that's all part of the service . __eou__  Thank you . I don't think there should be any problems , but just to be sure ... __eou__
 Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving . __eou__  OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ? __eou__
 Sure . By all means please do . Please take a seat . __eou__  Thank you . See , I ’ m planning to buy a car here and I ’ m planning to use my time deposit here as the collateral . __eou__
 Of course . __eou__  I'd like to change these dollars into RIB . Would you please tell me the exchange rate between American dollar and RIB ? __eou__
 OK . Thank you for your help . That's very nice of you . __eou__  It's my pleasure . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  I will give a call . __eou__
 Speaking . __eou__  Excuse my troubling you . You purchased our products last year and now I am following up to find out about their workings . Are they still in good condition now ? __eou__
 Yes . Our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange . __eou__  What kinds of currency do you change ? __eou__
 Sorry , but we can't do that . It's store's rule . __eou__  My husband said he had a credit card . Do you accept credit card ? __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  Is there anything else I can do for you ? __eou__
 Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . __eou__  I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production . __eou__
 We check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . As new orders keep coming in , they are working three shifts to step up production . I'm sorry , but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill . __eou__  Well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . What's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September . The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . But of course you cannot count on that . In any case , we'll let you know by email . __eou__  That's very considerate of you . And now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ? __eou__
 Yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . __eou__  Then please cover W . P . A . and TEND for this transaction . __eou__
 To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . __eou__  Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  Here is the 6,100 RIB . __eou__
 All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation . __eou__  Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount . You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers . __eou__
 We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price . __eou__  Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products . __eou__
 The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . __eou__  As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . __eou__
 Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . __eou__  1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . __eou__
 I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . __eou__  It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . __eou__
 I ’ Ve looked at your units , and I am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality . __eou__  We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits . __eou__
 That ’ s great . I ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . I ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning . __eou__  Fine . Also , would you mind if I asked to see a surveyor ’ s report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis . __eou__
 Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . __eou__  I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . __eou__
 I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . __eou__  But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . __eou__
 I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . __eou__  There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . __eou__
 As a rule , we don't allow any discount . __eou__  But we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . Actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know . __eou__
 I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive . Here is our offer . All the prices on the list are firm . If your order is a sizeable one , we could reconsider our prices . __eou__  Good . Is there any commission included ? We are commission agents . __eou__
 As a rule , we don't allow any commission . However , as an encouragement for businesses , we will allow you a 3 % commission . __eou__  Ok . How about the earliest possible shipment ? __eou__
 A higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time . __eou__  The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business . __eou__
 All right . Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only . __eou__  I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . __eou__
 Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . __eou__  That's understood . __eou__
 We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . __eou__  Thanks for your help . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind . __eou__
 Here are our catalog and price list . The catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles . __eou__  Thank you , Ms Chi . What are your normal export terms ? __eou__
 I am afraid that can't be done . We have never done business on such terms . __eou__  But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight . __eou__
 We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 . __eou__  That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . __eou__
 Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . __eou__  If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . __eou__
 Well . I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__  I hope you'll try to get them to step up production . __eou__
 All right . I'll take you at your word . __eou__  Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep . __eou__
 I am sorry , but we can't advance shipment . The manufacturers are fully committed . They have no stock on hand . __eou__  Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ? __eou__
 How's this then ? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready . __eou__  Sounds like a good idea . __eou__
 Wonderful ! We can meet your requirements and the offer is ready for you . Here it is . The unit price is USD 15.00 per kilogram . __eou__  Do you quote CIF or FOB ? __eou__
 You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__  Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__
 Here is our price list . All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation . You can see the prices are reasonable . __eou__  I'd like you to quote me CIF Karachi . __eou__
 That would be very kind of you . __eou__  Could you please tell me your phone number , so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ? __eou__
 Well . In that case we can offer you a private educational loan . __eou__  What's the interest rate ? __eou__
 Here you go , Miss . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 I'd be glad to . __eou__  I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country . __eou__
 Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you . __eou__  I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . __eou__
 Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . __eou__  Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future . __eou__
 We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__  I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__
 All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . __eou__  I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . __eou__
 No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . __eou__  Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . __eou__
 Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . __eou__  Good , that's all then . __eou__
 Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . __eou__  Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . __eou__
 We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... __eou__  Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? __eou__
 All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . __eou__  Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . __eou__
 If that's the case , there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . __eou__  What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . __eou__
 Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible . __eou__  What would you suggest ? __eou__
 You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again . __eou__  I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting . __eou__
 We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . __eou__  I'll come to that . My proposal is __eou__
 You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown . __eou__  On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . __eou__
 Take your time . __eou__  I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . __eou__
 When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . __eou__  How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__
 Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? __eou__  I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? __eou__
 Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . __eou__  So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . __eou__
 That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . __eou__  I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . __eou__
 I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go . __eou__  I'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.That is our bottom line . If you can meet that price , you've got the deal.Otherwise ... __eou__
 I understand . But unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . We also consider other elements , including design and practicality . We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company . __eou__  Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? __eou__
 That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional . __eou__  Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? __eou__
 Sure . No problem . __eou__  Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? __eou__
 Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . __eou__  It ’ s my pleasure . __eou__
 Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__  Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__
 Ah , get back to you . __eou__  Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ? __eou__
 Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . __eou__  But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... __eou__
 $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! __eou__  It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . __eou__
 No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . __eou__  So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . __eou__
 I think my husband has some . __eou__  Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you . __eou__
 That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself . __eou__  Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? __eou__
 Yes , it's the correct thing to do . __eou__  But we may not get another partner . __eou__
 So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt . __eou__  I think we'll get along fine . __eou__
 I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit . __eou__  To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost . __eou__
 That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . __eou__  Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . __eou__
 Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . __eou__  Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions . __eou__
 Exactly . That's what we have done in the past . __eou__  Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days . __eou__
 Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature . __eou__  That's fine too . __eou__
 Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__  Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . __eou__
 You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C . __eou__  That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation . __eou__
 Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . __eou__  If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner . __eou__
 All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another two weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect . __eou__  We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing __eou__
 Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . __eou__  Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__
 No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . __eou__  Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . __eou__
 Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . __eou__  Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . __eou__  I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . __eou__
 I don't think we can . __eou__  Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? __eou__
 That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . __eou__  I understand . __eou__
 But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . __eou__  Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . __eou__
 I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . __eou__  That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . __eou__
 I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . __eou__  It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . __eou__
 No , that won ’ t be necessary . __eou__  In that case , I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ’ ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here we ’ ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ? __eou__
 Oh , yes . Here it is . __eou__  Do you want large ones or small ones ? __eou__
 Wait a minute , please ... Here's the cash . __eou__  By the way , I'd like to change some U . S . dollars to pounds and I want to know today's exchange rate . __eou__
 ... OK . And here's your money . __eou__  Thank you . And goodbye . __eou__
 Here you are , a thousand Yuan and my ID . __eou__  Wait a moment , please ... Here is your bankbook . Keep it well please . __eou__
 OK . Here you are . __eou__  All right . And here's your deposit book . __eou__
 Yeah . Here's my identification card . __eou__  Do you want large or small bills ? __eou__
 Of course , we'd be happy to cash it for you . __eou__  What's the cashing rate ? __eou__
 OK , there you are . __eou__  And your passport please . __eou__
 Oh , I forgot to bring it . It is in my hotel room . __eou__  Sorry , sir . We can't cash the checks for you without your passport . __eou__
 Sorry , sir . We can't cash the checks for you without your passport . __eou__  Well , thanks . I will come again this afternoon , then . __eou__
 Right . Here it is . __eou__  Thank you . And what amounts do you want the checks in ? __eou__
 Okay , here you are . ( She hands the completed form and the money to the clerk . ) __eou__  Here's your $ 200 . __eou__
 Yes , Mr.Chen . Here you are . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 OK . Go ahead . __eou__  You see , if you press this red button , the helmet becomes an umbrella . __eou__
 Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer . __eou__  And how long do those take ? __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  How would you like your bills ? __eou__
 Yes , speaking . __eou__  This is Steven speaking . I'd like to buy a stock . __eou__
 Thank you , but I've never thought about it before . __eou__  It's OK . I'll leave the pamphlet here . If you need more information , you can call me any time . __eou__
 Ok , here you are . __eou__  Thanks.How would you like them ? __eou__
 This way , please . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Sure , Mr . Anderson , please come along with me . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  How would you like it ? __eou__
 I'm afraid we cannot help you , sir , because that would be violating the regulations . I owe an apology for doing nothing about it . __eou__  It's just too bad . I have to leave it as it is , and thank you just the same . __eou__
 OK . Here . __eou__  How would you like it ? __eou__
 Let me see them . Yes , they're OK . __eou__  What's the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ? __eou__
 Let me check with our credit manager . ( later ) Our record shows that your credit rating is quite high . I don't think you'll have any problems . __eou__  What's the current interest rate ? __eou__
 Of course , we can . __eou__  I want to be here tomorrow . What are your business hours ? __eou__
 Yes , here you go . __eou__  What amounts do you want the checks in ? __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Thanks . Er , mister , if I want to deposit checks next time . what should I do ? __eou__
 Thank you . Here you are . __eou__  How do you want your money ? __eou__
 Yes , I can . You know Mr . Macready , the famous car dealer here in New York . He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0 , 000 until the end of this year . __eou__  Good . He is a man of high standing . I think we can grant the loan you need after some further discussion . But I suggest you borrow on overdraft instead of on loan . __eou__
 Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan . __eou__  What about the loan repayment ? __eou__
 Yes . Here you are . __eou__  Wait a second , please ... These are 24,060 RIB and the receipt , please check them . __eou__
 All right , thank you so much , good-bye . __eou__  Good-bye . __eou__
 I will open it for you right now . __eou__  What's the minimum deposit for opening a current account ? __eou__
 OK , here you are . __eou__  Thank you . Please confirm your information and sign your name in the blank . __eou__
 OK . Thanks . Goodbye ! __eou__  Bye ! __eou__

 We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ... __eou__  That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . __eou__
Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop . Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you . First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development , Harvard's own Dr . James Smith . Dr . Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years , and has taught at Harvard since 1995 . And now , without further adieu , we'd like to welcome Mr . James Smith . __eou__  Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 . __eou__
Could I ask you for a favor ? My laser printer is out of ink and I need to print out something urgent . If you don ’ t mind , I would like to send you these files . Could you then print these for me ? __eou__  Sure , just send me through internal mail . __eou__
Could you please cover for me two hours this morning ? __eou__  Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are . __eou__
 I have to see the dentist . We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . So if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . If there is something urgent , tell them I will be back in two hours . __eou__  No problem . Good luck . __eou__
Hi , Monica , I am afraid I can ’ t make it to the office to punch out . __eou__  Where are you ? __eou__
 I am still in XYZ Company , this meeting took longer than I expected . Say to it that the office manager knows I won ’ t be in to punch my card . __eou__  Ok . __eou__
 Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . __eou__  Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ’ Ve got to be there , right ? __eou__
 Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__  Thank you so much . __eou__
Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? __eou__  What is the problem ? __eou__
 It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . __eou__  Thank you very much . I am sure good rest will do indeed . I don ’ t have this too often . __eou__
 I know , but I am really sick . __eou__  Well . I want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here . __eou__
 Well . I want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here . __eou__  I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Thomas __eou__
My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? __eou__  If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . __eou__
 If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . __eou__  How ? __eou__
 You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . __eou__  Very useful advice , I will try them right now . __eou__
Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . __eou__  I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . __eou__
 This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . __eou__  Thank you , I will be doing my best . __eou__
 That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . __eou__  Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . __eou__
 I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__  Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . __eou__
 Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . __eou__  How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? __eou__
 Mr . Smith , please . __eou__  Sorry , he is out . __eou__
 Sorry , I am not sure . Can I take a message ? __eou__  No , thanks . I will call back later . __eou__
 That ’ s fine . Please call again later . __eou__  OK . Thank you . Goodbye . __eou__
 We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ? __eou__  Yes . I ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 . __eou__
 I don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . If your prices are agreeable and if I can get the commission I want , I can place the order right away . __eou__  I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much . __eou__
 I ’ m glad to hear that . As I ’ Ve just said , I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . __eou__  We shall be very pleased . Is there anything else I can do for you , Mrs . Anderson ? __eou__
 We shall be very pleased . Is there anything else I can do for you , Mrs . Anderson ? __eou__  I ’ m buying for chain department stores in Canada . They are also interested in Egyptian carpets . Could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ? __eou__
 I ’ m buying for chain department stores in Canada . They are also interested in Egyptian carpets . Could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ? __eou__  Certainly , I ’ ll make an appointment for you with Mr . Jordan of the Egypt National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import and Export Corporation . __eou__
If you are staying here for a few days , we ’ d be delighted to see you at our factory . __eou__  It ’ s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory . __eou__
 Let us know when you are free . We ’ ll arrange the tour for you . __eou__  Thank you . I ’ ll give you a call this afternoon to set the time . There ’ s nothing like seeing things with one ’ s own eyes . __eou__
 Thank you . I ’ ll give you a call this afternoon to set the time . There ’ s nothing like seeing things with one ’ s own eyes . __eou__  That ’ s for sure . You ’ ll know our products better after the visit . __eou__
I ’ ll show you around and explain the operation as we go along . __eou__  That ’ ll be most helpful . __eou__
 That is our office block . We have all the administrative depart - ments there . Down there is the research and development section . __eou__  How much do you spend on development every year ? __eou__
 There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow . __eou__  Yes , I overlooked some facts . I ’ ll be more sorrow . __eou__
I ’ m glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . __eou__  It ’ s a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . Brown . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . May I know what particular items you ’ re interested in ? __eou__
 Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offers ? __eou__  I ’ ll do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of price ? __eou__
 I ’ ll do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of price ? __eou__  Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . __eou__
 You see , but I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even two or three percent would help . __eou__  That ’ s something we can discuss later . __eou__
 You need all your receipts for reimbursement . __eou__  You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start . __eou__  The basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . __eou__
 The basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . __eou__  It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? __eou__
 It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? __eou__  40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. __eou__
Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__  What do you need ? __eou__
 I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . __eou__  He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . __eou__
Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season . __eou__  Here you are . Do you need glue ? __eou__
With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? __eou__  What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? __eou__
 What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? __eou__  Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . __eou__
 I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . __eou__  We should be able to finish everything up before then . Let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting . __eou__
 We should be able to finish everything up before then . Let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting . __eou__  I propose we accept the minutes . __eou__
 What kind of action is required ? __eou__  If everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there're any objections or corrections , let me know . Next week , we can cast the final approval . __eou__
Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? __eou__  Go ahead , please . __eou__
 Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think a couple of days before I give you my final answer . __eou__  Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days . __eou__
Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer . __eou__  You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . __eou__
 You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . __eou__  Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market ! __eou__
 Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . __eou__  It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . __eou__
 It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand . __eou__  I don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time ... Both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important . __eou__
 That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . __eou__  Do we also need to punch out after work ? __eou__
 According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . __eou__  How about the lunch break , Lucy ? __eou__
 May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? __eou__  Sometimes , but not quite often . __eou__
 Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . __eou__  That is very kind of you . Thank you very much . __eou__
Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . __eou__  Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . __eou__

 Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? __eou__  Should each of us write separately ? __eou__
May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? __eou__  Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . __eou__
 Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . __eou__  I got it . __eou__
 Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . __eou__  I see __eou__
I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please . __eou__  Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? __eou__

 Sorry , I have no idea . You can call him there if you like . __eou__  Ok , I have the number . Bye ! __eou__
 Sorry , I can ’ t hear you . Could you please speak up a little ? __eou__  I said , is Mr . Thomas there ? __eou__
Mr . Thomas is making a long-distance call . Please wait for a few minutes . __eou__  Would you like some coffee or tea ? __eou__
 Coffee would be fine . __eou__  How would you like your coffee ? __eou__
 I like it black . __eou__  Coffee will be right with you . __eou__
 Hi , Lucy , are you free to talk ? __eou__  Not really , I ’ m in a meeting . Can I call you back in ... say ... 15 minutes ? __eou__
 Not really , I ’ m in a meeting . Can I call you back in ... say ... 15 minutes ? __eou__  Sure , speak to you later . It isn ’ t urgent . Maybe it is easier if I send you an e-mail . __eou__
 Sure , speak to you later . It isn ’ t urgent . Maybe it is easier if I send you an e-mail . __eou__  Ok , I ’ ll look out for it . Sorry , I can ’ t talk now . __eou__
May I speak to Mr . Thomas ? __eou__  Unfortunately , he has left for the day . __eou__
 I hate to trouble of you . But it is urgent . Please leave this message into him __eou__  I ’ ll make sure he gets the message . __eou__
Thank you for calling ABC Company , may I help you ? __eou__  I ’ m Liu Yi . I ’ d like to speak to Mr . Smith . __eou__
 I ’ m Liu Yi . I ’ d like to speak to Mr . Smith . __eou__  Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and James Smith , which one would you like to speak to ? __eou__
 I ’ d like to speak with Mr . Robert Smith . __eou__  He is on the line . __eou__
We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . __eou__  Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . __eou__
 Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . __eou__  Shall we need at one fifteen this Thursday ? __eou__
 We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__  Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . __eou__

Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
I've got some great news for you ! __eou__  Did you get the position you wanted ? __eou__
 We will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue with you or not . __eou__  Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye . __eou__
 Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? __eou__  No problem , here you are . __eou__
Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together . __eou__  This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . __eou__
Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? __eou__  Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? __eou__
 Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . __eou__  Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . __eou__
 Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . __eou__  Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . __eou__
Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ? __eou__  Yes , Sir . __eou__
 These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . __eou__  All right , who should I send them to ? __eou__
 Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? __eou__  Yes , it ’ s right . __eou__
 Let me check . It has a paper jam . __eou__  I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . __eou__
Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . __eou__  Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__
 Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__  What are they ? __eou__
 They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . __eou__  And what is the most important point ? __eou__
 Shall I see you on Friday morning ? __eou__  That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time . __eou__
 We must find some time to read report . __eou__  I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . __eou__
 I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . __eou__  That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . __eou__
Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? __eou__  Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . __eou__
 Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . __eou__  I think I can handle it by myself . __eou__
 I think I can handle it by myself . __eou__  I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__
 I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__  I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__
 Other company rules also need your attention . __eou__  Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__
We have the orientation this afternoon . __eou__  What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? __eou__
 I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . __eou__  Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? __eou__
 Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? __eou__  Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . __eou__
 Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . __eou__  I got it . Thank you so much . __eou__
 Good afternoon . My name is Monica . I am here for the job interview at 2 PM . __eou__  Ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . You can do it in the next door . __eou__
 Ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . You can do it in the next door . __eou__  Done . Here is my paper . __eou__
 Everybody attention . I would like to make sure you all know the process . The interview consists of three parts . One , all of the interviewees will answer the question there and lasts for maximum one hour . Two , we will take a 30 - minute ’ s break . After the break , we all come back to this office and I will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round . In which , you have a small interview with your future manager . __eou__  What about the 3rd round ? __eou__
 Do you mind I have a look at your computer ? __eou__  Of course not , I appreciate that . __eou__
 I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . __eou__  No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . __eou__
Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ? __eou__  Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ? __eou__
 Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office . Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__  Ok . __eou__
 I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . __eou__  I guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine . I would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products . __eou__
 Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . __eou__  First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . __eou__
John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute . __eou__  Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment . __eou__
 John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion . __eou__  Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . __eou__
 Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . __eou__  Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . __eou__
 I ’ m calling to see if you have made your decision . You are the right person we are seeking for . __eou__  Yes , I have decided to work with your company . __eou__
 Ok , please come to my office at 9 AM next Monday . I will introduce you to our boss . __eou__  No problem . Thank you for calling me . __eou__
Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations . __eou__  What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? __eou__
Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you . __eou__  What can I do for you ? __eou__
 Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion . __eou__  Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ? __eou__
 We aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . We would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other . __eou__  So if I can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ? __eou__
Please send this memo out to all the managerial staff ... there will be training for all the department heads next week . Attendance for managerial staff is mandatory , except for the financial department . Financial officers may participate if their schedules allow . __eou__  You would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? I'm sorry , sir , could you please clarify ? Who all is included in managerial staff ? __eou__
Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? __eou__  Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . __eou__
 Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . __eou__  But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? __eou__
 Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . __eou__  It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? __eou__
 Could you tell me something about it ? __eou__  Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company . __eou__
 Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports . __eou__  And I represent ? __eou__
 Our company just concluded a business transaction . You can help with documenting varies financial sheets involved in this transaction . __eou__  Ok , thank you . __eou__
Bob , can I talk to you for a minute ? There have been some developments for the Stewart case that I really need to talk to you about . __eou__  Yeah , what's the matter now ? We've had so much trouble with this case already . Don't tell me there's more bad news . __eou__
We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? __eou__  We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . __eou__
 We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . __eou__  No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? __eou__
 We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . __eou__  Are you kidding ? __eou__
Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis . __eou__  Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? __eou__
 Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ? __eou__  No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 . __eou__
How can I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith . __eou__
 Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith . __eou__  Do you have an appointment ? __eou__
 I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? __eou__  Sure . __eou__
 Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? __eou__  That would be very nice . Thank you . __eou__
 I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__  Ok . __eou__
 Yes , Do you mind if I have a look at your computer ? __eou__  Of course not , I appreciate that . __eou__
 Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . __eou__  Good idea . __eou__
 So you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__  Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . __eou__
 Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? __eou__  No problem , here you are . __eou__
 Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . __eou__  Shall we need at 1 fifteen this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__
 Shall we need at 1 fifteen this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__  Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . __eou__
Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . __eou__  Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . __eou__
 Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? __eou__  Should each of us write separately ? __eou__
I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please . __eou__  Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? __eou__
 Would you please ask when he will be free ? __eou__  Have a seat please while I call . __eou__
 You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . __eou__  You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . __eou__
 Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . __eou__  Sure . __eou__
 Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . __eou__  I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? __eou__
 I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . __eou__  I will call them this afternoon , thanks . __eou__
 Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . __eou__  That is very kind of you . Thank you very much . __eou__
 Can I see it for a second ? __eou__  Sure , here it is ... __eou__
Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? __eou__  Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repairman to do it . __eou__
 Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repairman to do it . __eou__  I think I can handle it by myself . __eou__
 I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__  I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__
 Other company rules also need your attention . __eou__  Like this one ? __eou__
Can you help me for a minute ? __eou__  Sure , what I can do for you ? __eou__
 You can just put Dear Sir or Madam , officialese not personal , you can write to whom may concerned . __eou__  OK , So I first thanks them for their business , I can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support , How is that ? __eou__
 Good ! But also , write off the bed you want to tell them the reason of your writing , give them more reference . __eou__  Like Regarding our new product line , we would like to announce a special price discount __eou__
 That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . __eou__  Do we also need to punch out after work ? __eou__
 According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . __eou__  How about the lunch break , Lucy ? __eou__
 May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? __eou__  Sometimes , but not quite often . __eou__
May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? __eou__  Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . __eou__
 Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . __eou__  I got it . __eou__
 Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . __eou__  I see . __eou__
We'd like to welcome everyone to the Michelson Tools factory site , and thank everyone for being here today . My name is Paul Shafer , I'll be showing you around today . Please feel free to ask questions at any point during our tour , I'll be happy to answer questions for you . __eou__  Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ? __eou__
 That's an excellent question . I'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . The reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . As you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear . __eou__  How long will the tour take ? __eou__
Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? __eou__  We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . __eou__
 You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . __eou__  OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? __eou__
 I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . __eou__  OK , will do . __eou__
 Everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk . But I noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred . Maybe you can take a look at them . If the copy is unreadable , I'll call them and ask them to relax . __eou__  Yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed . These copies are so dark , I can't make out any of the words . __eou__
 Yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed . These copies are so dark , I can't make out any of the words . __eou__  What about that one ? __eou__
 You know , I think the fax machine is out of toner , I can change the toner cartridge . That should solve the problem . __eou__  Yes , but this one will have to be re-faxed as well . And look , there's about three pages missing ! It looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes , and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light , they're unreadable ! __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I would like to place an order for toner cartridges . We have a standing agreement with you company , so we will need the same amount as last time . __eou__

 That ’ s alright , . I think I should be able to make it at one fifteen . Can you put me down for that time slot ? __eou__  No problem . I have you appointment changed from tomorrow morning to tomorrow afternoon at one fifteen . __eou__

Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? __eou__  Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? __eou__
Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . __eou__  Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__
 It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . __eou__  Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . __eou__

OK , so now the last point on our agenda . Jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement . __eou__  Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see , is that our expenses are through the roof . __eou__
Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . __eou__  I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . __eou__
 Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? __eou__  There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . __eou__
 Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . __eou__  I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . __eou__
Tell me a little bit about yourself , please . __eou__  My name is Dunlin and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I will graduate from Peking University this July . I have majored in accounting . __eou__
 Would you tell me something about your family ? __eou__  There are three in my family , my parents and myself . My father is a teacher and my mother is a worker . __eou__
Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed . __eou__  Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear.If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . __eou__
 Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear.If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . __eou__  Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . __eou__
 Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . __eou__  Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around 16 . __eou__
 I see . Okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? __eou__  Sure . __eou__
 No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__  Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . __eou__
 That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__  Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__
 Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . __eou__  Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? __eou__
 Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? __eou__  I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day . So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . __eou__
 I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day . So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . __eou__  It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . __eou__
 It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . __eou__  Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__
 Oh , come on ! I have sixteen items ! Cut me some slack , will ya ? __eou__  Fine ! Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . Do you prefer paper or plastic ? __eou__
 Plastic . I also have a couple of coupons . __eou__  No problem , I ’ ll take those . Sir , these coupons expired yesterday . __eou__
 Yeah I got a club card . Here you go . __eou__  Will this be debit or credit ? __eou__
 Debit please . Also , could I get cash back ? Fifty dollars would be great . __eou__  Yeah , sure . Your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents . Here is your receipt . Have a nice day . __eou__
 No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems .

 So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background . __eou__  Sure ! Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology . __eou__
 Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle . __eou__  Yeah , I worked as their customer support manager , which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care , and process management . I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction . __eou__
So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . __eou__  Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__
 Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! __eou__  Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . __eou__
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . __eou__  You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? __eou__
 I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! __eou__  I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . __eou__
Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something . __eou__  Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ? __eou__
 Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . __eou__  You wanna take some time off , is that right ? __eou__
 You wanna take some time off , is that right ? __eou__  Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . __eou__
 Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . __eou__  What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . __eou__
 I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? __eou__  Well , I guess so . __eou__
Tell me about yourself and your past experience . __eou__  I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company .

 Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question . __eou__  OK , please . __eou__
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position . __eou__  The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence . __eou__
 Can I give her a message for you ? __eou__  Yes , please tell her I stopped by . __eou__
 And your name , please ? __eou__  Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ? __eou__
 Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ? __eou__  Certainly . __eou__
Excuse me , sir . I am coming to apply for the position of accountant . __eou__  Oh , please sit down . What university did you graduate from ? __eou__
 Can you name some of the courses you completed in relation to accounting ? __eou__  Sure . I took such courses as accounting principles , commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic data processing accounting , and accounting involved in foreign capital enterprises . __eou__
 Can you tell me something about this balance sheet now ? __eou__  Of course . This balance sheet contains three major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . So , you see , the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372 , 000 , and the owner's equity is $ 5,400 , 000 . That means that the total assets , which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities , are $ 8,772 , 000 . __eou__
Come in , please . __eou__  Good morning , Mrs Smith . __eou__
 Good morning . You are Mr . Sun , aren't you ? Take a seat , please . __eou__  Yes , thank you . __eou__
 You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English . __eou__  No problem . The professional English course is just English for Accounting . Moreover , as you know , the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture . When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English . __eou__
 I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July . __eou__  Thank you , Mrs Smith . It is really a pleasure talking with you . __eou__
Tell me about yourself and your past experience . __eou__  For the past 3 years , I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited . I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths . I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member . __eou__

 Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them . __eou__  I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step . __eou__
 I think you'll find I'm worth that . __eou__  I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ? __eou__
 I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ? __eou__  Yes , it is quite reasonable . __eou__
 If you are hired , you are in charge of the design of toys that can meet the needs of the American market . __eou__  I know it is a crucial position , but I can do it well . So I'm asking for 200,000 Yuan a year as a starting salary . __eou__
 I know it is a crucial position , but I can do it well . So I'm asking for 200,000 Yuan a year as a starting salary . __eou__  Ok . __eou__
 How do you feel about an annual salary of 100,000 Yuan plus bonus . __eou__  That's a little less than I expected . But to me , the most important thing is the job and the people I will work with . Moreover , I am sure I will get a raise quickly depending on my background and experience . __eou__
Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . __eou__  What is it ? __eou__
 Come on , what have you got to lose ? __eou__  What about my resume ? __eou__

Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ? __eou__  What do you want to know ? __eou__

Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out . __eou__  Has anybody spoken to him about it ? __eou__
 How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? __eou__  Oh , that would be too small . __eou__
 Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . __eou__  Let ’ s rock n ’ roll . __eou__

 I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . __eou__  Alright . I understand .

 What about the commission ? From European suppliers , I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports . It's the general practice . __eou__  As a rule we don't allow any commission . But if the order is sizable one , we will consider it . __eou__
 You see I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even 2 or 3 % would help . __eou__  We'll discuss this when you place your order with us . __eou__
 Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand . __eou__  I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways . __eou__
Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? __eou__  Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . __eou__

 Just a moment . I am sorry . At the moment , he is out of the office . Would you like to leave your number ? When he comes back , I will tell him to call you back . __eou__  Please have him call me at my office . He knows the number . __eou__
 Please have him call me at my office . He knows the number . __eou__  Of course . __eou__
 Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ? __eou__  Is it urgent ? __eou__
 Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? __eou__  No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . __eou__
 Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it . __eou__  Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ? __eou__
 Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list . __eou__  You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ? __eou__
 Can I see Mr . Cooper , your manager now ? __eou__  Let me see if he is free . Would you please sit down and wait for a moment ? __eou__

 Is there anything else I can help you with ? __eou__  Yes , maybe . The ad in the newspaper said you wanted the resume , a cover letter , and two letters of recommendation . I included those things in the envelope . Is there anything else I should send ? __eou__
 No , that is all we need . If we have those things included , that is sufficient . __eou__  Do you know when they will start setting up interviews for the job ? __eou__
 If you have any further questions , you can call any time . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Yes . When can I get the decision ? I hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible . If I'd turned down , I ll have to secure a position elsewhere . __eou__  All right , then . We'll get in touch with you within a week . Thank you for coming today , Mr . Sun . __eou__
Liz , do you have a minute ? __eou__  Yes , of course . What is it ? __eou__
 I need you to help me set up for my presentation Thursday morning . __eou__  Okay , what should I do ? __eou__
 Well , I need the display monitor.But Tom can set that up for me on Wednesday . I will need you to help with everything else . __eou__  I suppose you need the whiteboard set up . __eou__
 Oh , I'm so lucky . I want to apply for it . __eou__  But do you have any experience like that ? __eou__
 Well , it seems that you have all the practical experience to handle these cases . I am very glad to welcome you into our company . __eou__  Thank you . It's my honor . __eou__
 Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in . __eou__  Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? __eou__
 They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth . __eou__  Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them . __eou__
 When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ? __eou__  Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check . __eou__
 Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ? __eou__  No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ? __eou__
Well , Yuri , tell me about it . __eou__  I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster . __eou__
 It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ? __eou__  Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car.If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch . __eou__
 I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now.Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe . __eou__  Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ? __eou__
Excuse me , can you tell me which is Bob Rice's office ? __eou__  Sure . It's the third office down this hall . Are you looking for Bob ? __eou__

Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . __eou__  Good morning . __eou__
 Would you like something to drink ? __eou__  No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . __eou__
 Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? __eou__  I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . __eou__
 I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . __eou__  I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . __eou__
 I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . __eou__  It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . __eou__
 Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . __eou__  What do you suggest ? __eou__
 The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . __eou__  You mean because people have to go across town to get here . __eou__
 Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . __eou__  Well . __eou__
 I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . __eou__  You mean you want to run the meetings ? __eou__
 No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . __eou__  Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . __eou__
 I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . __eou__  I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . __eou__
 Could I speak to Mr Wood , please ? __eou__  I'll see a piece available , who should I say is calling , please ? __eou__

 Hold the line , please.Mr Wood is in the meeting with managing director at the moment I afraid.Can I help you ? __eou__  Well , I want to discuss with them the new control we said last week . __eou__
 Well , I want to discuss with them the new control we said last week . __eou__  I don't think the meet will go on much longer , should I ask him to call you when he is free . __eou__
 Could I have your name again , please ? __eou__  Yes , It's John eng . __eou__
 Ok , you will be hearing from Mr Wood later in the afternoon then , Mr John . __eou__  thank you for help.good bye . __eou__

 All right.Take a seat , please.Would you like to be a shop assistant or a cashier ? __eou__  I can do the work of shop assistant and I worked part time in a small department store during my summer vocation last year . __eou__
 Now we really need some part-time workers.You see , our full-time staff knocks off at five pm , but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm.We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm.But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job.Since most of our customers are foreign , competence of good communication in English is necessary here . __eou__  I think I can . I have been learning English for almost 5 years and especially I am fluent at speaking English.Also , I have made some foreigners friends during the experience of learning English . __eou__
 That is fine . I think you have the qualifications needed for the job , so I will let you have the job.Does the work schedule suit you ? __eou__  It quite suits me . I am free in the evening these days , I will have no difficulty starting at five pm . __eou__
 Good.There is only thing to be settled.Ten RIB an hour is the maximum we can pay you.Is the rate of pay acceptable to you ? __eou__  It seems reasonable.By the way , I can get my earning raised with a excellent performance , can't I ? __eou__
 It seems reasonable.By the way , I can get my earning raised with a excellent performance , can't I ? __eou__  Sure.You will get more if you can invite more customers with your good service . __eou__

 Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . __eou__  I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . __eou__
 Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . __eou__  I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . __eou__
 Oh , that's too bad . I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital . She is going to deliver a baby . I must take the day off to go to the hospital . May I talk to him to ask for leave ? __eou__  I am afraid not , but I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes . __eou__

This is what my boss is expecting , Sandy . He wants a detailed list of expenses and equipment costs . __eou__  That ’ s going to take a while to put together , Paul . __eou__
 The sooner , the better , Sandy . I don ’ t think he ’ ll sign anything till he ’ s got that in his hands . __eou__  I ’ ll get to work on it right away . Anything else ? __eou__
Hi , Alex . Would you come with me to supply ? I ’ Ve got to pick up a load of stuff and I ’ m afraid I can ’ t carry it all . __eou__  Sure , Stacy . Let me just grab my coat . __eou__

 Well . I was just wondering if you would come by and give me a hand with the fliers for next week ’ s party . __eou__  I ’ m sorry , Melissa . I really can ’ t today . I ’ Ve just got too much going on . Maybe tomorrow . __eou__
Susan , we ’ re going to need those data before tomorrow . __eou__  I know . I ’ m just waiting for confirmation on one of them . I can get them to you by tomorrow morning . __eou__
Mr . Martin ? I need to talk to you for a minute . __eou__  Certainly , Mr . Emory . Is there a problem , sir ? __eou__
 Well , I ’ d just like you to help me with the holiday schedule . __eou__  Fine , Mr . Emory . Let me just grab a pad and pen . __eou__

Could I trouble you for a minute , Mr . Graham ? __eou__  Sure , Emily . How can I help you ? __eou__
 I would like to leave a few minutes early today . Would that be all right ? __eou__  That ’ s fine , as long as you can get that report typed up before you leave . __eou__
 I think it would have been better if you had given us more of a chance to give our opinions . __eou__  I ’ m sorry . I thought we were all pretty much in agreement . __eou__
 It ’ s John Anderson . I ’ m afraid I ’ m going to be out sick today . I ’ Ve got a nasty cold . I hope you don ’ t mind , ma ’ am . __eou__  No , that ’ s no problem . I ’ m sorry to hear you ’ re not feeling well . Get some rest . If you need to see a doctor , let me know . __eou__

Excuse me , Mr . Graham ? I have something I need to discuss with you . __eou__  I ’ m in a bit of a hurry , Louise . Can it wait ? __eou__
 I ’ m in a bit of a hurry , Louise . Can it wait ? __eou__  I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in . __eou__
 I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in . __eou__  All right . Why don ’ t you have a seat ? What ’ s the problem ? __eou__
Greg . I want to speak to you for a minute . __eou__  Yes . Ms . Gray . Is there something wrong ? __eou__
 I ’ m afraid there is , Greg . I don ’ t mind you taking a break . But you ’ Ve been away from your desk for twenty-five minutes already . __eou__  I ’ m sorry , Ms . Gray . I must have lost track of the time . I ’ ll get back to work , now . __eou__
Farmington ? Would you take a look at these catalogue ads that Roger did ? I don ’ t think we can use them . __eou__  Hmm . I see what you mean . Have you spoken with Roger ? He usually does better work than this . __eou__
 I know , Mr . Farmington . But , I ’ m not sure that I should bring this up with him . I think it would be better if you spoke to him . __eou__  All right . Leave these ads with me . I ’ ll speak to him this morning . __eou__
Mr . Crandall , I ’ m sorry , but I really don ’ t see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch . It would take a lot of work . __eou__  That ’ s certainly true . But , that ’ s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable . __eou__
 That ’ s certainly true . But , that ’ s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable . __eou__  I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance . __eou__
 I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance . __eou__  All right , Maria . I ’ ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ’ ll have to re-do it . __eou__

I have to talk to you ! __eou__  What , Hilary ? I ’ m really in a hurry ! __eou__
 I know , Blake . But you ’ Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company . __eou__  I ’ Ve been busy , Hilary . We can set up a meeting to talk about the deal , but I still feel the same way . I don ’ t think it ’ s worth it . __eou__
 Well , I ’ d like to reschedule my flight for the tomorrow morning one at 9:05 . Is that possible ? __eou__  I ’ m very sorry , Miss Parks , but the 9:05 flight is completely booked . I can put you on a waiting list if you would like . __eou__

 Hi , Karen . This is John Williams in the purchasing department . Can you check to see if there ’ s a package down there for me ? __eou__  Certainly , Mr . Williams . Just one moment , please . __eou__
 I ’ Ve got some bad news . All the plans sent over to the McGrath Corporation have been rejected . We ’ re going to have to start from scratch . __eou__  I thought they had already agreed to everything . That ’ s going to take weeks to rework . __eou__

I would like to take my vacation next month . __eou__  How long did you have in mind ? __eou__
 That's right . If sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics . __eou__  Let's give it a shot ! __eou__
Would you consider an offer of $ 56,000 per year ? __eou__  What kind of benefits are we talking about ? __eou__
 Are these things negotiable ? __eou__  Uh ... not normally . What do you have in mind ? __eou__
 Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days . __eou__  What an interesting idea , Ms . Wilson . Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ? __eou__
 What an interesting idea , Ms . Wilson . Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ? __eou__  Possibly . What do you have in mind ? __eou__
I ’ m so sorry to call you on such short notice , but something ’ s come up . __eou__  You mean for this afternoon ’ s meeting ? __eou__
 That ’ s right I ’ m afraid I have to postpone it . Mr . Scott got sick and I have to attend the Speechmaker ’ s Symposium in his place . I ’ m leaving today , and I won ’ t be back until a week from Friday . __eou__  That ’ s quite a while . Let ’ s make it the week after you get back , then . __eou__
 That ’ s quite a while . Let ’ s make it the week after you get back , then . __eou__  That will be great . So it ’ s two weeks from tomorrow , same time and place . I ’ m really sorry to do this to you . __eou__
 That will be great . So it ’ s two weeks from tomorrow , same time and place . I ’ m really sorry to do this to you . __eou__  No problem at all . To tell you the truth , I could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork . __eou__
From reviewing your resume I can see that you have ample experience for this position.What I want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job . __eou__  Well I ’ m impressed with what the company has done in the past and I think by hiring me the company ’ s future can only be brighter . I find that my personal goals and ideas about business operation __eou__
I really think if I can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career . Do you think you can help me polish my interview style ? __eou__  Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off . __eou__
 Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves . __eou__  I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ? __eou__
 Sounds good . Everyone is taking about teams these days . Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ? __eou__  I see myself as an encourager . Of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . In my last job , each representative handled __eou__
 I can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for Corporate World Unlimited from 1997 to 1999 . Can you please tell me about your responsibilities ? __eou__  Yes . I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada . As a manager , I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period . __eou__
I can ’ t attend the meeting in Washington . I ’ Ve proposed you as the most able substitute . __eou__  But I ’ Ve never been on a business trip before ! __eou__
 It ’ s easy enough . Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses . __eou__  So the company will pay for everything ? __eou__
 Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . __eou__  That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ? __eou__
 I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center . __eou__  You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ? __eou__
 You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ? __eou__  Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ? __eou__
 That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients . __eou__  Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking __eou__
Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? __eou__  Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design __eou__
 Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ? __eou__  Not at all . Go right ahead . __eou__
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself ? __eou__  I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately 10 years . __eou__
 Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills . __eou__  I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system __eou__
 Oh , right . You ’ re in our system . I was just looking under Li . So , we ’ Ve got you down for a Business Suite for three days . If I could just have your credit card , I ’ ll process your check-in while __eou__  You mean I have to pay now ? __eou__
 Oh no , we just make an impression of your card using our credit card machine . It ’ s in lieu of a deposit . If everything is OK when you check out , we give it back to you then . It ’ s pretty sta __eou__  I see . I guess you can tell I don ’ t travel much . __eou__
Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? __eou__  Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . __eou__
I ’ m ready to settle the bill . __eou__  I hope you enjoyed your stay . __eou__
 Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__  What ? I only stayed three nights . __eou__
 Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? __eou__  Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her . __eou__
 The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . __eou__  What ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ? __eou__
I want some envelopes please . __eou__  Do you want the large size , or the small size ? __eou__
 The large size please . Do Have you any writing-paper ? __eou__  Yes , we do . I don't have any small pads . I only have large ones . Do you want a pad ? __eou__
 Yes , please . And I want some glue . __eou__  A bottle of glue . __eou__
 And I want a large box of chalk , too . __eou__  I only have small boxes . Do you want one ? __eou__
 I only have small boxes . Do you want one ? __eou__  No , thank you . __eou__
 OK . See you at your office at 2:30 . __eou__  Right , see you then ! __eou__
Hey there ! I ’ Ve been hoping to run into you . Are you busy tomorrow morning ? __eou__  Let me see ... Wednesday morning . Yes , I am booked solid all morning . What ’ s up ? __eou__
 I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . I ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . It has a lot of complicated form __eou__  I can explain them to you . It ’ ll just take about a half an hour . How about Friday afternoon ? __eou__
 I can explain them to you . It ’ ll just take about a half an hour . How about Friday afternoon ? __eou__  Ooh . Sorry , that ’ s not good for me . I am tied up all day Friday . We ’ ll have to do it next week . I am wide open then . __eou__
 OK . Shall we say next week , on Tuesday at 2:30 ? __eou__  Sure , that ’ ll be fine for me . I ’ ll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros . __eou__
 This is Denise , Mr . Bruce ’ s Secretary . I was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with Mr . Dome at 4 o ’ clock . __eou__  Yes , it ’ s confirmed for here in our office . __eou__
 Great , thanks . I was calling to change our meeting next week . __eou__  Ok , sure . When did you have in mind ? __eou__
 Well , I was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , Our trip has been postponed until the 2nd . __eou__  Why don ’ t ’ we say the 3rd around 2:00 p . m . ? __eou__
 Why don ’ t ’ we say the 3rd around 2:00 p . m . ? __eou__  That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here to catch flight 513 to New York . __eou__  May I see your ticket please ? __eou__
 May I see your ticket please ? __eou__  Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ? __eou__
 Any form of picture I . D . will do . __eou__  Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ’ s license . Is that ok ? __eou__
 Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ’ s license . Is that ok ? __eou__  That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ? __eou__
Hi I came in on flight 513 . Everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt , but mine didn ’ t seem to be there . __eou__  Let me check the computer . Uh-oh , Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris . __eou__
 Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number . __eou__  You can reach me at 13661306917 . __eou__
 Thank you . I am terribly sorry about this . It very rarely happens . We do have a sophisticated tracking system , so I know we will find it soon . But we apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__  That ’ s ok . There wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . The shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage . __eou__
I would like to buy a ticket to New York please . __eou__  When do you plan to travel ? __eou__
 I ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight . __eou__  Are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ? __eou__
 I wish I could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket . __eou__  When would you like to return ? __eou__
 My return date will be the 14th . __eou__  OK . I have several seats available . Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? __eou__
 Anything but a center seat is fine with me . The middle seat drives me crazy ! __eou__  OK Mr . Lee . I have you booked on flight 513 leaving on the 5th at 11:00 pm and arriving in New York on the 6th at 6 __eou__
 So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . __eou__  Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? __eou__
 I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? __eou__  What seems to be the problem ? __eou__
Good morning . Please come into my office . __eou__  Good morning . Thank you . __eou__
 I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__  No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? __eou__
 It ’ s possible . If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there . __eou__  You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! __eou__
 This is a rotten way to start a vacation . I HATE lines ! Can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__  Certainly . You will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience . __eou__
We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this . __eou__  OK . Let me send a memo around . __eou__
 Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back . __eou__  I don ’ t think he ’ s back today . __eou__
 Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! __eou__  I know , it ’ s a big one . __eou__
 Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday . __eou__  Great . __eou__
Do you mind if I smoke here ? __eou__  Yes , I do . I ’ d prefer you didn ’ t . The AC ( air-conditioning ) is also on . __eou__
 Can I just turn off the AC for now and open the window and smoke indoors ? __eou__  That ’ s not a very good idea . It ’ s quite hot outside . Why don ’ t you smoke outside ? __eou__
 That ’ s not a very good idea . It ’ s quite hot outside . Why don ’ t you smoke outside ? __eou__  It ’ s very hot and that ’ s why I ’ d like to smoke inside . __eou__
 Though the AC has the air-purifying function . I ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke . Are you okay with that ? __eou__  Oh , no problem . __eou__
 yes , but I have a few questions for you . __eou__  Ok . Ask away . __eou__
 first , I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave . __eou__  yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . __eou__
 yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ? __eou__  we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract . __eou__
 I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . __eou__  well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? __eou__
 well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? __eou__  I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . __eou__
 I'm sorry to hear that , but you don't need to quit over that . Why don't you just take a leave of absence ? We can hold your job for you until your mother gets better . __eou__  really ? I didn't know that would be possible . __eou__
 did you get to leave early then ? __eou__  my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time . __eou__
 my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time . __eou__  it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that . __eou__
Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ? __eou__  sure . What do you need ? __eou__
 I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? __eou__  of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally . __eou__
 I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people . __eou__  there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers . __eou__
 there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers . __eou__  that's perfect . I'll let him know tomorrow . Thanks ! __eou__
 the reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . __eou__  oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . __eou__
 I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . __eou__  I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? __eou__
 I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? __eou__  that will be fine . __eou__
 don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . __eou__  it was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , ONC small mistake can cost the company millions . __eou__
 if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . __eou__  I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! __eou__
 Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . __eou__  Thanks , I appreciate that ! __eou__
 I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . __eou__  thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! __eou__
 can you think of anything else ? __eou__  sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . __eou__
 that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . __eou__  absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . __eou__
 no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of __eou__  sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention . __eou__
 yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . __eou__  got it . I'll start right now . __eou__
 thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? __eou__  sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . __eou__
 sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . __eou__  yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ? __eou__
 you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil __eou__  then what should I do when I'm being interviewed ? __eou__
 smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . Try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview __eou__  are there any other things I should pay attention to ? __eou__
 Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__  Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? __eou__
 Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? __eou__  Yes , of course . That's quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance al __eou__
 Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . __eou__  Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . __eou__
Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? __eou__  I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . __eou__
 Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . __eou__  Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? __eou__
 Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that so __eou__  That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . __eou__
 I hope to hear from you very soon . __eou__  Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye . __eou__
 Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . __eou__  That sounds ideal . __eou__
Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . __eou__  Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__
 Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__  Yes , please . __eou__
Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ? __eou__  Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . __eou__
 I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? __eou__  Yes , okay . __eou__
hi . Could you give me a hand with this report ? __eou__  sure . I ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . __eou__
 thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at . __eou__  it looks good to me . I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . The bosses seem to like that . __eou__
 it looks good to me . I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . The bosses seem to like that . __eou__  that ’ s an excellent suggestion . I can easily do it on the computer . __eou__
 why don ’ t you use a different font the headings ? They ’ ll be more distinct . __eou__  I ’ ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ? __eou__
 I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly . __eou__  is it ok to include the pictures ? __eou__
 is it ok to include the pictures ? __eou__  definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible . __eou__
 definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible . __eou__  thanks for those ideas . I ’ ll get to work on them right away . __eou__
we ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . We don ’ t want to make any mistakes . __eou__  ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ? __eou__
 that ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s __eou__  from next week on , we should be in less of a rush . __eou__
 I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it . __eou__  don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear . __eou__
 I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . __eou__  I will . Enjoy your meeting ! __eou__
 I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections . __eou__  that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted . __eou__
 may I make a suggestion ? __eou__  sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . __eou__
 Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? If they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . You won ’ t get credit for ide __eou__  I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea . __eou__
We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? __eou__  That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? __eou__
 See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too . __eou__  Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . __eou__
 The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . __eou__  Do you enjoy working in this office ? __eou__
 That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . __eou__  I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of __eou__
 I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of __eou__  Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . __eou__
 Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? __eou__  The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? __eou__
Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday . __eou__  Ok . I understand that we basically work form 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ? __eou__
 That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . __eou__  That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ? __eou__
 That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ? __eou__  Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . __eou__
 You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects.Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee __eou__  I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together . __eou__
 Yes . Let ’ s say Tuesday at noon . Bring your portfolio with you . __eou__  Certainly . Is there anything else you would like me to bring , Mr . O ’ Brian ? __eou__
can you squeeze me in sometime today ? __eou__  That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . __eou__
 I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . __eou__  Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ? __eou__
Excuse me , Mr . Rodriguez ? Could I speak with you for a moment ? __eou__  I can ’ t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ? What ’ s it about ? __eou__
 Well , I ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you , if that ’ s all right . __eou__  Oh , that ’ s right . Is that time of the year , huh ? That ’ s fine . How about if we meet at 3:30 this afternoon ? __eou__
 Not at all , sir . I ’ d just like to push it up to next week . I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week . __eou__  Well , I don ’ t like it , but I guess I don ’ t have any choice . __eou__
 I would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account . __eou__  Certainly , Mr . Murphy . Could you come to my office this afternoon at 2:30 ? __eou__
Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? Mr . Macmillan , would like to know if you have the completed schedule for next week ? __eou__  Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is . __eou__
 Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is . __eou__  Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you . __eou__
 I know , but I want to make reservations this week . __eou__  Okay . I ’ ll bring them in tomorrow for sure . __eou__
Hey , could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ? __eou__  The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ? __eou__
 I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ? __eou__  OK , I am ready to think of other things . __eou__
 When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed . Does that make sense ? __eou__  I think that their attitude is rather casual . __eou__
 You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ? __eou__  Yes , where should we go from here ? __eou__
 Could you work for us in another state , if need be ? __eou__  I need to stay in the area because of my family . __eou__
Can you help me plan the office party ? __eou__  Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ? __eou__
 I need help with food . __eou__  OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ? __eou__
 I think it should be casual . __eou__  I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ? __eou__
 I would prefer Chinese food for this party . __eou__  Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ? __eou__
 I think we should hire a live band . __eou__  OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday . __eou__
Could I meet with you to discuss the project ? __eou__  Good idea . We could meet on Monday or Tuesday . Which day would you prefer ? __eou__
 Tuesday would be good for me . __eou__  OK . Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon ? __eou__
 I think the afternoon would be best . __eou__  That will work out . I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow . I need you to bring your plans with you . __eou__
 That will work out . I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow . I need you to bring your plans with you . __eou__  Yes , I will bring my plans with me to the meeting . __eou__
 I feel that the whole committee needs to be there . __eou__  Yes , I agree . We'll make sure that they get notified . Can you find the meeting place ? __eou__
I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting . __eou__  Of course , I have Monday or Tuesday available . What day would be best for you ? __eou__
 I would like to meet on Monday . __eou__  Very well then . Are mornings or afternoons best ? __eou__
 I want to come in the morning . __eou__  I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ? __eou__
 I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ? __eou__  Yes , I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting . __eou__
 I think that we should have just the sub-committee . __eou__  OK then , I will make the arrangements for them to attend . Do you know how to get there ? __eou__
 No , I need directions , please . __eou__  Fine , we will make sure that we send you all of the information that you need . See you there ! __eou__
Will you tell me the situation ? __eou__  I was in my friend's room , talking for an hour or so . __eou__
 No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? __eou__  Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? __eou__
 Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . __eou__  Should I call the police ? __eou__
 Look ! This window is open . __eou__  Did you open it before we left ? __eou__
 Look around . __eou__  The TV's still here . __eou__
 And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs . __eou__  But what if someone's still up there ? __eou__
Hey man , you wanna buy some weed ? __eou__  Some what ? __eou__

 But we need the exact time . What time ? __eou__  Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside . __eou__
 OK , well after you take one out of that second drawer , you put your name on the top . Do you see ? __eou__  I am kind of confused . __eou__
 Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ? __eou__  No , I have no idea what you are talking about . __eou__

Can you help me with my timesheet ? __eou__  Sure ! I can help you . Do you know where the timesheets are kept ? __eou__
 Well , once you get one off the shelf over there , you first put your name on it . OK ? __eou__  Yes , I can do that . __eou__
 OK , so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it . Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes . OK ? __eou__  Yes , I understand how to do this . __eou__
 After you total your hours , make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor . __eou__  That was easy ! __eou__
I need help with my timesheet . __eou__  OK , no problem . Have you found the blank ones ? __eou__
 Yes , well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website . OK ? __eou__  Yes , I understand what to do . __eou__

I want to make a phone call . Can you show me how ? __eou__  Of course , pick up the receiver , hit a button and listen for a tone . Are you hearing it ? __eou__

 A dressy party would be fun ! __eou__  That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ? __eou__
 We should probably have both . __eou__  Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ? __eou__
 Maybe we could do both ! __eou__  Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details . __eou__
Can you tell me what happened here ? __eou__  Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can . __eou__

 I'm just fine , thanks , Jane . I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account , please . __eou__  Would you like a balance inquiry first , Mr Mayhew ? __eou__
 I need some advice about my fixed deposits . __eou__  What seems to be the problem ? __eou__
 Mmmm ... well , I am happy with your service so far , so I'd like to renew it , please . __eou__  Not a problem . But may I just inform you that we have introduced a new service called Account Renewing upon Maturity ? __eou__
 You see , that means when anything is up for renewal , we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out . All you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you . __eou__  That's just perfect for me . I live pretty far from the centre and it can be a chore getting in . __eou__
 Can I give you some advice on a loan , or ... __eou__  I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please . __eou__
 I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please . __eou__  Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do . __eou__
 Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , I've been stuck in back to back meetings all day , but I really wanted to come and speak to you . __eou__  What can I help you with ? __eou__
 Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ? __eou__  Yes , I've heard about that . Isn't it where many investors pool their money together ? __eou__
Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan . __eou__  OK , what does that entail ? __eou__
 It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . __eou__  Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ? __eou__
 Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu . __eou__  Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today . __eou__
 Hello , Shelly , is it ? I'm here on behalf of my company , so I'll need the Corporate Banking Services . __eou__  That's no problem ; I can take care of that for you . __eou__
 I need to have a credit check done for my company . __eou__  If it's this kind of consultancy service , I'll have to direct you to another department , I'm afraid . __eou__
 There are many services you can choose from . Why don't you take a look at this leaflet while I find someone who can help you ? __eou__  Great . I'll wait right here , thanks . __eou__
 I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please . __eou__  Certainly . Do you currently bank with us ? __eou__
 Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? __eou__  What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . __eou__
 Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . __eou__  Have you invested in the stock market before ? __eou__
 Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . __eou__  We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? __eou__
 What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__  Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! __eou__
 I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . __eou__  Are you an existing customer ? __eou__
 Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . __eou__  May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance . __eou__
 I'd like to apply for a credit card with you . __eou__  Would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ? __eou__
 Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . __eou__  Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . __eou__
 Hello . I'm here to talk about my credit card . You see , I'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . I've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me . __eou__  Right . Well , the benefits are a little different . With our Corporate Card you can use it for agency collection and payment . __eou__
 I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult . __eou__  How so ? __eou__
 I'm not exactly prepared right now . How about I go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ? __eou__  I'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting . __eou__
 Hello . Yes , I've just read your leaflet about the new MoneyLink Card . I was wondering how I go about applying for one . __eou__  This scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks . __eou__
 May I have your details , and I'll check for you . __eou__  Certainly ... __eou__
 We will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company , the company address ... __eou__  Yes , yes . I've got all of that here . __eou__
 And also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number . __eou__  Check , check and check . __eou__
 As it's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it shouldn't take too long . There is , of course a service fee of 300 RIB to be paid . __eou__  No problem , I'll settle that now . You can take it from my Business Account . __eou__
 Could I open an account with you today ? __eou__  Of course , it can be done right this minute . If you could just fill in this application form for me ? Do you have your ID card with you ? I'll need to see that . __eou__
 Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card . __eou__  Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ? __eou__
Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ? __eou__  Speaking . __eou__
 Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you . __eou__  Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon . __eou__
 Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with . __eou__  I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ? __eou__
 That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card . __eou__  Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye . __eou__
 I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter . __eou__  Unfortunately , an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money . That's what's causing the hold up . __eou__
 You are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . Could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ? __eou__  I did that already , while I was waiting . Also , here's my card . __eou__
 Please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . And sign here , please . __eou__  OK ... __eou__
 Thank you . Here's your card back and your money . Please double check it for me . __eou__  Yes , that's great . Thanks . __eou__
 Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number . __eou__  Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money . __eou__
 As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives . __eou__  I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks . __eou__
 Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card . __eou__  What seems to be the problem ? __eou__
 Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons . __eou__  Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me . __eou__
 I'd like to pay some money in using my card , please . __eou__  No problem . Could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ? __eou__
 No problem . Could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ? __eou__  Here it is . I usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . __eou__
 That's correct , 1,000 RIB . I'll need your personal code to deposit this . Could you enter it on this key pad , please ? __eou__  OK , done . When will it show in my account ? Not for withdrawal , I mean just registered . __eou__
 It will show in your account straight away . Here's your card back and could you please sign the slip here ? __eou__  That's fine . OK . Thanks . __eou__
 That's the opinion of most people . Do you have your passport with you ? I'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form . __eou__  Fine . Here you go . __eou__
 Is it OK to withdraw USD ? __eou__  That's fine . __eou__
 OK , 200 USD , please . __eou__  Here's your money , your card and your passport . Please double check the amount for me . __eou__
 Here's your money , your card and your passport . Please double check the amount for me . __eou__  Perfect . Thanks ! __eou__
 I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? __eou__  That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service . __eou__
 That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service . __eou__  A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ? __eou__
 I'm not sure if I'm at the right counter , but I need some advice on mortgages , can you help me ? __eou__  Unfortunately , no , I can't . But our specialist can . Please take a seat and our Mortgage Adviser will come out to see you . __eou__
 No problem , Sir . He'll be with you in just a minute . Could I get you something to drink while you are waiting ? __eou__  A black coffee with 2 sugars would be much appreciated , thanks . __eou__
 So , you've already made a large initial deposit ? That is good news . OK , let's have a look at your credit details and get this started . __eou__  I already have an account with you , so it should be pretty straight forward . __eou__
 Yes , please . I'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates . __eou__  I see . We offer Personal Housing Loans , or mortgages , at a rate of 0.42 % per month . __eou__
 Then we can certainly help you with that . You see , for shorter term loans , we can offer an even more competitive interest rate . __eou__  Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ? __eou__
 Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? __eou__  We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . __eou__
 We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . __eou__  I see . What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible . __eou__
 I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . __eou__  Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs . __eou__
 That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this . __eou__  The funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it . __eou__
 I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan . __eou__  Not a problem . We offer a Personal Loan for Studying Abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . Anyone is eligible to apply __eou__
 Not exactly . Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse . __eou__  I see . What about age limitations ? __eou__
 There are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age . __eou__  Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much . __eou__
 Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today . __eou__  OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? __eou__
 OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? __eou__  Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ? __eou__
 Yes , I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . I'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please . __eou__  Right , that's no problem . I see you are already well informed . If you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees . __eou__
Did you need help with something ? __eou__  I don ’ t know where to get my ballot . __eou__
 May I see your ID ? __eou__  Here it is . __eou__
 Go to a voting booth and vote . __eou__  All right . Thanks for your help . __eou__
 Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll be fine . __eou__  That ’ s good to know . __eou__
 You ’ ll be okay . __eou__  Thanks for telling me . __eou__
 Are you serious ? __eou__  I ’ m not sure what I ’ m doing . __eou__
 Voting is easy . __eou__  I don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass . __eou__
 The ballot gives you all that information . __eou__  Nobody told me that before . __eou__
 You have nothing to worry about . __eou__  I ’ m so glad you told me that . __eou__
 What about him being black ? __eou__  I guess America is finally maturing . __eou__
 My name is Alice Lin , and I need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet . __eou__  Just one second , and I'll check . __eou__
 I need to know how much money is in my account . __eou__  I'll need your name and account number . __eou__
 I'll need your name and account number . __eou__  Certainly . __eou__
 Don't worry ; I can help you with that . I understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving . The first thing we need to do is check the ATM is in service . This one is fine . __eou__  Yes , I sure can . I feel like a dinosaur with all of these youngsters and their electronics . This machine is working , then ? __eou__
 Yes , this one is in service . Put your card in here , in this slot and wait a moment . Then you will see some instructions on the screen . __eou__  Oh , it wants me to put in my PIN number . OK , I can do that ... __eou__
 And press ' enter ' to confirm , here . Now you need to decide which service you need . __eou__  There are so many to choose from . I didn't know you could do all of this using a card . __eou__
I hope you can help . I've got a bit of a problem with your ATM . __eou__  Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ? __eou__
 I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ? __eou__  Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see . __eou__
 Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you . __eou__  Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ? __eou__
 Thank you , yes . I'm not sure how to use this ATM , I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book . But today , I thought I'd try something new . I want to take some money out . __eou__  Welcome to the electronic age ! I can run you through it ; it's what I'm here for . __eou__
 Just look at the screen here . It'll give you prompts , you see ? Now you need to enter your PIN number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it . __eou__  Then it'll give me my money ? __eou__
 Yes , I am expecting some money wired to my account from Taiwan . Would you please check if the money available yet ? __eou__  Sure , may I have your name and account number please ? __eou__
 Certainly , that's what we're here for . What can I help you with ? __eou__  I'm a tourist in this city and unfortunately I've lost my card ! __eou__
 That's fine , Sir . Let me just take some details FRCM you and we can help you . __eou__  Thank you . Thank you very much . __eou__
 Did you check with reception at your hotel ? __eou__  Yes , I did . But nobody has handed it in as yet . __eou__
 OK , that's fine , Sir . We just need to ask you some questions for security purposes . __eou__  Please , go right ahead . __eou__
 Could I have your name , please ? And do you know your card number ? __eou__  I'm Mike Kowalski and my card number is 5211678 44 , but there are some other numbers at the beginning . I'm not sure what they are . __eou__
 That should be fine , Mr Kowalski . And your PIN number ? __eou__  It's 671029 , my birthday . Silly to choose such a simple one , I suppose ! __eou__
 We have many loans on offer . May I ask what the purpose of the loan is ? __eou__  I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child . I'd like to buy a car for the family . __eou__
 Could you tell me what the requirements are for that , please ? __eou__  Certainly . It's quite simple really . Do you hold a resident's permit ? __eou__
 That's great . We'll also need details of your occupation . __eou__  I have all of that with me . I've also banked here for a number of years . __eou__
 Yes , I am . I opened an account with you about a month ago , but today I'm here to see about a loan of some kind . __eou__  I see . As you don't have a long history with us , we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you . __eou__
 I see . As you don't have a long history with us , we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you . __eou__  Yes , that's fine . My credit is good ; I banked at my former bank for many years . __eou__
 We always welcome new business . If you can give me the details of your former bank , including your account number we can begin . __eou__  I have everything right here . I'll let you go through that and come back . I'd like to have a good read of your materials to make sure I make the right choice . __eou__
 Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... __eou__  OK , as I expected . How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean , I don't need a massive sum of money . __eou__
 It's a little sensitive , actually . I need to get hold of some money , and quickly . __eou__  OK , Madam . We are here to help . __eou__
 I understand completely . There are other options , such as a Personal Pledge Loan . __eou__  I've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ? __eou__
 I've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ? __eou__  The procedure is really simple and convenient . All you need to do is fill in this Loan Application form . __eou__
Welcome back , Sir . I trust the materials were helpful to you ? __eou__  Indeed . I've decided to go for the Petty Consumer Loan . That is , if my credit rating is satisfactory . __eou__
 I need some documentation from you . Such as your resident permit , your occupation and salary details and I already have your credit details here . __eou__  Everything is right here . If that's all in order , just let me know where I sign . __eou__
 Hello . Could you give me some details about your Personal Pledge Loans , please ? __eou__  Certainly , Sir . I'd be happy to . The Personal Pledge Loan is a loan secured by undue certificates , Time Deposits , for example , or Visible Treasury Bonds . __eou__
 So , as long as I have one of those , I can apply for a Personal Pledge Loan ? __eou__  That's correct , Sir . The bank will issue receipt to you and also take care of all the pledged securities . __eou__
 Hi , I'm looking into your loans and I'm a little confused about the interest rates . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__  Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . __eou__
 I ’ m not sure where to pick up my ballot . __eou__  I can assist you . __eou__
 Do you have ID ? __eou__  I have it right here . __eou__
 Would you like to ask me anything ? __eou__  What do you feel about gay marriage ? __eou__
You know who won the election , right ? __eou__  I ’ m still shocked that Obama was elected . __eou__
 You didn ’ t tell me you were working there this year . __eou__  I do this every year . __eou__
 You should try actual fundraisers , too . __eou__  What else can we do ? __eou__
 Try having a car wash or selling candy . __eou__  I didn ’ t think of that . __eou__
 You should do something else . __eou__  Do you have any suggestions ? __eou__
 Try a car wash and selling candy . __eou__  That is a good idea . __eou__
Would you like to make a donation ? __eou__  Donations for what ? __eou__
 You should try other fundraisers . __eou__  Like what ? __eou__
 You can always wash cars and sell candy . __eou__  That ’ s a great idea . __eou__
 What would you like to ask me ? __eou__  What is your stand on gay marriage ? __eou__
 You can ask me questions , if you ’ d like . __eou__  I want to ask you what your policy is on gay marriage . __eou__
I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind . __eou__  What would you like to speak to me about ? __eou__
 I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election . __eou__  Is that right ? __eou__
 Go to your polling place early on Election Day . __eou__  I will . Good luck with your volunteering . __eou__
 I want to ask you a couple questions . __eou__  Go for it . __eou__
 Could I ask you some questions ? __eou__  Sure , you can . __eou__
 I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions . __eou__  Ask away . __eou__
 Can you just tell me ? __eou__  The election is this Tuesday . __eou__
 Could you please look at the five men in this line-up ? __eou__  All right . __eou__
 Please take a careful look at these five men . __eou__  Okay . __eou__
 Could you come to the station for more questioning ? __eou__  That'll be fine . __eou__
 Would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning ? __eou__  I would be happy to . __eou__
 I must ask you to pick him out of a line-up . __eou__  That won't be a problem . __eou__
 Look closely at the five men in this line-up . __eou__  I am looking . __eou__
 Thank you for all your help . __eou__  It was no problem at all . __eou__
 Tell me what else happened . __eou__  He got the money and tried to leave . __eou__
 Could you explain what you saw ? __eou__  I was in the bank at the time of the robbery . __eou__
 Would you come down to the station for further questioning ? __eou__  That shouldn't be a problem . __eou__
 I need to hire you . __eou__  What do you need me for ? __eou__
 I need you for my court date . __eou__  What kind of case do you have ? __eou__
 I can help you with that . __eou__  What is your price ? __eou__
 I charge $ 150 an hour . __eou__  I can ’ t afford that . __eou__
 That ’ s my rate . __eou__  That ’ s expensive , but I need you . __eou__
 I ’ m in need of your services . __eou__  What do you need me for ? __eou__
 I have a court date coming up . __eou__  What are you being charged with ? __eou__
 It ’ s the felony charge . __eou__  I ’ m willing to provide my services . __eou__
 I work for $ 150 an hour . __eou__  That ’ s too high . __eou__
 That ’ s what I charge . __eou__  I ’ ll hire you anyway . __eou__
 I'll send a squad car . __eou__  Please hurry . __eou__
 I will send a squad car to your house right now . __eou__  Please do . __eou__
 I need to go to the police station . __eou__  Do you want me to take you ? __eou__
 Do you want me to take you ? __eou__  That would be great . Thank you . __eou__
 I need to make a statement at the police station . __eou__  I'll take you , if you'd like . __eou__
 I'll take you , if you'd like . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 I have to file a report at the police station . __eou__  Let me take you . __eou__
 Let me take you . __eou__  I would like that . __eou__
 I'm going to have to write you a ticket . __eou__  You can't give me a break ? __eou__
 You can't give me a break ? __eou__  I'm just doing my job . __eou__
 I'm going to give you a ticket . __eou__  Why can't you just let me off with a warning ? __eou__
 Why can't you just let me off with a warning ? __eou__  It's just a ticket . __eou__
 I have to write you a ticket . __eou__  Can't you give me a warning ? __eou__
 Can't you give me a warning ? __eou__  I'm not going to be able to do that . __eou__
Order ! __eou__  Your Honor , I am ready to make my plea . __eou__
 Your Honor , I am ready to make my plea . __eou__  What ’ s your plea ? __eou__
 I am pleading not guilty . __eou__  But all the evidence points to you . __eou__
 Will you let me go if I tell you ? __eou__  We can work something out . __eou__
Order in the court ! __eou__  I would like to make my plea . __eou__
 I would like to make my plea . __eou__  What is it ? __eou__
 I would like to plead not guilty . __eou__  You do realize that all the evidence points to you ? __eou__
 If I tell you who did , will you release me ? __eou__  I ’ m sure we can work out some kind of deal . __eou__
You ’ re all set to leave . __eou__  I can ’ t believe it . __eou__
You ’ re free to go . __eou__  That ’ s great . __eou__
You ’ re free to leave . __eou__  I ’ m so excited . __eou__

 The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check . __eou__  What happens now ? __eou__
Unfortunately , according to our regulations I have to confiscate these counterfeit notes . __eou__  So , this 500 RIB is worthless ? __eou__
 I'm sorry but it is our regulation , so I must follow it . We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated .

 Hello , I'd like to talk to someone about making a withdrawal . __eou__  You can withdraw money from your account either over the counter or via the ATM . __eou__
 You can withdraw money from your account either over the counter or via the ATM . __eou__  Yes , but the problem is that I have a Savings Account with you , and I need to take some money from that . Do I really have to give 90 days notice if I want my money ? __eou__
 Actually , you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds . Of course , you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal . __eou__  That's not a problem . I'll pop in later today to make a formal request . Thanks ! __eou__
 I'm sorry , could you be a little more specific ? __eou__  You know my bank stuff . My card , my book ... __eou__
 OK , I will have to take some details from you . Could you tell me your name , please ? __eou__  Jim Chan . The account's in my name . Is that all you need to know ? __eou__
 What I need you to do first is fill in these forms , with as much detail as possible . Then we can get you a new card . __eou__  So , I can get my new card today ? __eou__
After you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead . __eou__  Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ? __eou__
 First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . __eou__  OK , let's get the ball rolling on this . __eou__
 Unfortunately , if you wish to withdraw on your C / D before the pre-decided date , you must give notice . __eou__  Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ? __eou__
 No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago . __eou__  You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit , right ? __eou__
 That's correct . But before I do , I was wondering if you could give me some advice . __eou__  Of course , Mr Hayes . That's what I'm here for . What would you like to know ? __eou__
 This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ? __eou__  No , not really . My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it . __eou__
 I need to report a missing Bank Card and Book . __eou__  OK Sir . Could you tell me the account holder's name , the account number , the amount in the account and your PIN number , please ? __eou__
 OK Sir . Could you tell me the account holder's name , the account number , the amount in the account and your PIN number , please ? __eou__  Well , the account's in my name . Patrick Dean , that's D-E-A-N . The account number is 15273478841 . There was about 20,000 RIB inside . __eou__
 OK , Sir . Almost there , I just need your PIN number . When we issue you with a new card and book we would recommend that you change your PIN number . It's a very simple procedure . __eou__  OK , it's 672910 . __eou__
 Hello . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account . __eou__  I see . Well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . There are 7 to choose from __eou__
 Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ? __eou__  Maybe I'll go for the US dollar account . __eou__
OK , now let's go on to talk about initial deposits . __eou__  Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ? __eou__
 For Agreement Savings , we ask for 100,000 RIB . __eou__  And how do I withdraw if I need to ? __eou__
 You can use a Type A Agreement Savings Account the same was as a Settlement Account . __eou__  I'm sorry , refresh my mind . What's different about a Type B Account ? __eou__
 Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ? __eou__  Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ? __eou__
 Fixed . __eou__  And how long are you depositing for ? __eou__
 There's quite a large difference . I mean , if you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0.13 % interest , but for a time deposit , of say , 1 year we would offer 0.82 % . __eou__  Yes , I couldn't agree with you more . A 1 year time deposit it is ! __eou__
 Hello , Miao Ping . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account today . __eou__  That shouldn't be a problem , Mr Fang .

 I need to open a US dollar account , trade with America is going up each year . __eou__  We will transact this for you as soon as we can after the materials you have given me have been checked and verified . __eou__

 Hello . I'm a Financial Manager in a local company and we'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account with you . __eou__  I see . That shouldn't be a problem , Sir . Which currency would you require ? __eou__
 The first step is to fill in the Account Opening Application and the accompanying Seal Card , stamped with your company's seal . I mean , the business seal and the corporate seal . We also need your Business Licence and the Enterprise Standard Code Certificate . Then we can go on to the next step . __eou__  That's great . Let's begin as soon as possible . __eou__
 Hi there . I need to change some dollars into local currency . Can I do that here ? __eou__  Yes , you can . Is that US dollars or HK dollars ? Both are available for exchange to RIB . How much would you like to exchange ? __eou__
 Yes , please . Can I exchange money here ? __eou__  Here we can exchange HAD , USD and Euros . Which do you require ? __eou__
 To be honest , I really wanted to exchange my GAP , but I suppose USD will be fine . I have some and I just need a little local currency for expenses . Could you tell me what the rate is like today ? __eou__  At the moment it's 830.43 RIB for 100 USD , which is a pretty good rate . __eou__
 Oh , wonderful ! You speak English ! I need to exchange this foreign currency . __eou__  That's no problem . Is it cash ? __eou__
 Of course . If you could sign your name on the bottom line here , and write your address here . And please sign and date the back of every cheque and of course I'll need to see your passport . __eou__  Yes , right , certainly . Here you go . __eou__
 Hello . I want to buy some RIB , is it OK to use US dollars ? __eou__  Yes , of course . What's the amount you'd like to change ? __eou__
 Please fill out this exchange form and I'll need to see your passport . Don't forget to sign your name at the bottom . __eou__  Oh , right , of course . Here you go . __eou__
 Here is your RIB , the exchange form and receipt and your passport . Please check the amount . __eou__  It's correct . Is there any way I can change it back before I leave the country ? __eou__
 Yes , that can be done here . Just make sure you keep the exchange form and the receipt and you can come back at the end of your stay and we'll be only to happy to change it back into foreign currency . __eou__  That's wonderful news , thanks for all your help . __eou__
 That does depend on where you plan to travel . If you are planning to travel to Hong Kong or Macao we can exchange up to 1,000 USD for you . If your destination is elsewhere , we can exchange up to 2,000 USD . __eou__  OK , well , I'm going to Europe . I guess 1,000 USD will be sufficient for now . __eou__
 Sorry to say it , but neither of those . I'm here to close our account with you . The market around here has been dropping for a while now , and it's just not sensible for us to stay . __eou__  I understand . So , what would you like to do with the balance ? __eou__
 I guess I should just withdraw everything . __eou__  215,000 RIB is the exact balance . If you could just sign your name here . __eou__
 215,000 RIB is the exact balance . If you could just sign your name here . __eou__  Here you go . That's everything , then . Thanks very much for your service over the years . __eou__
 Could you fill me in on the details for buying foreign currency ? __eou__  Of course . Where are you planning to travel to ? __eou__
 That's fine . If you are travelling outside of Mainland China , Hong Kong and Macao we need to follow the SAFE rules . This means that you can exchange 2,000 USD or equivalent . __eou__  That sounds fine . I'll bring in my passport and everything tomorrow . Thanks . __eou__
Would you like to know about benefits and so forth ? __eou__  Please . Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something ! __eou__
 It's very quick and easy . It just takes 24 hours , we guarantee that . All you need to do is fill in this slip and we can proceed . __eou__  Are there any extra charges , like commission ? __eou__
 I've got a Remittance Advice and I'd like to cash it . __eou__  I can do that for you . Could I see the Remittance slip ? __eou__
 I can do that for you . Could I see the Remittance slip ? __eou__  Here you are . I'm here on business and this is from my boss , it's for my expenses so I need cash . __eou__

 If you choose our Urgent Remittance Service the money can be there within 2 hours . There will be a 1 % handling fee and then you need to pay 12 RIB for the Express Delivery Service . __eou__  Right , that's fine . I'd like it to get there as quickly as possible . __eou__
 Right . I'd like to deposit 2,000 RIB into my Current Account . __eou__  No problem . Could I have the cash and your Bank Book , please ? Oh dear ... there seems to be some problems here ... __eou__

 Hello , Miao Ping . It's that time again ; I want to convert my salary . You know , it's so annoying . I wish my company could just pay me in RIB . __eou__  Haha ! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars . __eou__
 Thanks , Mr Janus . Of course I trust you , but regulations are regulations . __eou__  Here you go . __eou__
 Yes , please . 70,000 US dollars is being transferred into our account . __eou__  Which company are you from ? I'll check your details . __eou__

 Well , I'm only here for 3 days , so I think 500 GAP should be plenty . __eou__  Please fill in this exchange form , and I'll need to see your passport , and sign here . That's the money and your passport back . Of course , if you don't spend all of it , you can come back and we'd be happy to buy the local currency back from you . __eou__
 OK , could you give me your details and I'll see if it has cleared . We need your banking details and some ID . A passport or something like that ? __eou__  I have my passport right here , and here are the account details . The name , number ... __eou__
 That was quick ! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly . Yes , that is good news . The full amount should be 20,000 Euros , is that right ? I'd like to withdraw 5,000 Euros worth of local currency , if that's possible . __eou__  Not a problem , Sir . Please fill in this exchange form and show me your passport . __eou__

 We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world . They are certainly the most versatile . __eou__  But what if something happened to them ? What would happen to my money ? __eou__

 Hello . I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C ? What is it exactly ? __eou__  L / C stands for ' letter of credit ' . This is necessary for trade between two countries . A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . Nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too . __eou__

 I want to effect payment under an L / C today . __eou__  No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction .

 Hello . I'm Ms Dawson from Lexington Software . I need to send these documents to Vietnam via L / C . __eou__  No problem , I can do that for you right now . Have you checked the documents ? __eou__
 I have , but I have never done this before so would it be possible for you to double check them ? __eou__  Of course , that's all part of the service . __eou__
 Don't worry ; I'm sure it will be fine . If I do have any queries I'll call you , OK ? __eou__  That's fine . Thank you again . __eou__
 Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates . __eou__  Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ? __eou__
 OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ? __eou__  No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in . __eou__
 I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible . __eou__  I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now . __eou__
 You're right , no problems . You are becoming quite the expert , Mr Lawson . If any problem does turn up , which I'm sure it won't , I'll give you a call . __eou__  Thanks very much . I'm sure I'll be back , so see you again soon . Bye ! __eou__
 Well , it's here now . Shall we credit that straight to your account ? __eou__  If you could , please . That would be wonderful , thanks . __eou__
 I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about a loan I want to make . __eou__  Sure . By all means please do . Please take a seat . __eou__
Excuse me , will you change me some money , please ? __eou__  Of course . __eou__
 I'd like to change these dollars into RIB . Would you please tell me the exchange rate between American dollar and RIB ? __eou__  Sure . At present one dollar is equal to 6.4392 yuan . How many dollars would you like to change ? __eou__
 Please wait for a moment ... Now here is your Chinese currency . See if it's right . It's 3,220 yuan . Please keep this exchange memo . You may need it for converting when you leave China . __eou__  OK . Thank you for your help . That's very nice of you . __eou__
 Well , I'd like some legal advice . Jane and I are thinking of incorporating . So Want to find out what sort of legal procedure one follows in forming a corporation . __eou__  You begin by applying for a corporate charter . And then stockholders hold a meeting to organize the corporation , an individual has limited liability and the right . __eou__
 You begin by applying for a corporate charter . And then stockholders hold a meeting to organize the corporation , an individual has limited liability and the right . __eou__  I know . I have an idea that we get together to discuss this next week . __eou__
 I know . I have an idea that we get together to discuss this next week . __eou__  OK . __eou__
Hello , this is Steven from Blue Sky Co . May I speak to Mr . James ? __eou__  Speaking . __eou__
 Yes . Do you exchange foreign money here ? __eou__  Yes . Our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange . __eou__
 Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ? __eou__  The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars . __eou__
 I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here . __eou__  Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there . __eou__
 Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 No , thanks . My husband said , We'd like to pay now . __eou__  Let me show you to the cashier's . It's 905 yuan in total . __eou__
 Let me show you to the cashier's . It's 905 yuan in total . __eou__  What ? Where does that five come from ? __eou__
 But I only have 900 in cash here . Can you let it go for 900 yuan ? __eou__  Sorry , but we can't do that . It's store's rule . __eou__
I'd like to open a one-year time deposit account and a checking account . __eou__  Okay , if you'll please fill out these forms ... ( She hands the forms to the customer . ) There's a minimum initial deposit of $ 100 for the checking account , and a minimum deposit of $ 500 for the savings account . __eou__
 Okay , if you'll please fill out these forms ... ( She hands the forms to the customer . ) There's a minimum initial deposit of $ 100 for the checking account , and a minimum deposit of $ 500 for the savings account . __eou__  Okay , here are the forms . Can I use traveler's checks to open the account ? __eou__
 Certainly . Just make them out to National Bank , and sign and date them . __eou__  Okay , here you are . __eou__
 Yes , I want to deposit 1000 Yuan in my bank account . __eou__  Please fill out this deposit form , first . __eou__
 Please fill out this deposit form , first . __eou__  OK ... Here you are . Any problem on that ? __eou__
 Wait a moment , please . __eou__  Sure . __eou__
 Yes . I want to make a remittance to New Delhi . __eou__  Do you want an international money order or a banker's draft ? __eou__
 Hello , I want to remit one thousand Yuan to Magnolia Company . __eou__  Please fill out this form , please . __eou__
 Please fill out this form , please . __eou__  OK ... Do I put on Magnolia Company for the receiver ? __eou__
 Yes . You must put on its name and full address . __eou__  OK , I see . Here you are . Is that OK now ? __eou__
 Let me check . Yes . Your one thousand remittance , please . __eou__  Here you are . What is the rate ? __eou__
 No . That's all . You have to take good care of this copy of this transfer order . __eou__  Thanks , I will . __eou__
Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ? __eou__  Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . __eou__
 I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production . __eou__  We check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . As new orders keep coming in , they are working three shifts to step up production . I'm sorry , but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill . __eou__
 All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September . __eou__  Good . Let's call it a deal . We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September . The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . But of course you cannot count on that . In any case , we'll let you know by email . __eou__
 Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ? __eou__  Yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . __eou__
 Then please cover W . P . A . and TEND for this transaction . __eou__  All right , I'll adjust the price accordingly . __eou__
 Well , I can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract . __eou__  That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? __eou__
 That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? __eou__  Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . __eou__
 Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . __eou__  That would be fine . We could accept a lower rebate . __eou__
 That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . __eou__  To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . __eou__
 Yes , I'd like to change Australian dollars for RIB . __eou__  How much do you want to change ? __eou__
 Well , I want to change 1000 Australian dollars for RIB . __eou__  Okay . Please sign here in this form . __eou__
 Okay . Please sign here in this form . __eou__  OK . __eou__
I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon . __eou__  Please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges . __eou__
 Please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges . __eou__  I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . __eou__
 Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount . You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers . __eou__  We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price . __eou__
 Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products . __eou__  The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . __eou__
 As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . __eou__  Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . __eou__
 1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . __eou__  I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . __eou__
 It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . __eou__  All right . See you tomorrow . __eou__
I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting quality . __eou__  I ’ Ve looked at your units , and I am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality . __eou__
 Well , we ’ re really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want . __eou__  That ’ s great . I ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . I ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning . __eou__
 I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . __eou__  Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . __eou__
 Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . __eou__  Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon . __eou__
 Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon . __eou__  Sure , no problem . __eou__
I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . __eou__  We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . __eou__
 We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . __eou__  Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . __eou__
 I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . __eou__  I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . __eou__
 But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . __eou__  I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . __eou__
 There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . __eou__  Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose . __eou__
I wonder if you could allow us any discount for this commodity . It's the general practice that wholesalers usually get some discount from manufacturers or suppliers . __eou__  As a rule , we don't allow any discount . __eou__
 But we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . Actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know . __eou__  That's true . But I am sorry I can't make an exception . We have quoted you our lowest price . We can't give you any more discounts . __eou__
I hope we could offer the most favorable terms . __eou__  I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive . Here is our offer . All the prices on the list are firm . If your order is a sizeable one , we could reconsider our prices . __eou__
 Good . Is there any commission included ? We are commission agents . __eou__  As a rule , we don't allow any commission . However , as an encouragement for businesses , we will allow you a 3 % commission . __eou__
 Could you make an offer on FOB basis ? __eou__  Certainly ! __eou__
Shall we discuss the packing ? You know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . I'd like to see the sample of packing . __eou__  We have made a lot of improvement in packing . You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom . I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done . __eou__
We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet . __eou__  How much would you like ? __eou__
 10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity . __eou__  A higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time . __eou__
 The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business . __eou__  Of course I know . But there is too high a rate . Frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % . __eou__
We'd better cover the porcelain ware against All Risks . __eou__  All right . Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only . __eou__
 I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . __eou__  Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . __eou__
I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? __eou__  I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . __eou__
 In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . __eou__  What are they ? __eou__
 First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? __eou__  That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? __eou__
 The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . __eou__  We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . __eou__
 Welcome to this corporation , Mr . White . Won ’ t you please sit down ? __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Yes , we have . I ’ Ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year . Here is a copy of it . __eou__  Good . Well , Mr . White , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery . __eou__
 Good . Well , Mr . White , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery . __eou__  I hope so , too . Now I'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles . __eou__
 I hope so , too . Now I'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles . __eou__  Here are our catalog and price list . The catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles . __eou__
 What about tomorrow morning at 9 ? I'll come over to your hotel . __eou__  I'll be expecting you , then . __eou__
 We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg . Is it at sight or after sight ? __eou__  At sight of course . __eou__
 Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . __eou__  I am afraid that can't be done . We have never done business on such terms . __eou__
 But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight . __eou__  We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 . __eou__
 That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . __eou__  Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . __eou__
 If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . __eou__  Thank you . I am glad we have come to an agreement at last . __eou__
 That's right . Let's go into the details . __eou__  Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of Sep . We'd like them to be there in time for our Christmas sales . __eou__
 Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of Sep . We'd like them to be there in time for our Christmas sales . __eou__  Christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year , right ? __eou__
 I hope you'll try to get them to step up production . __eou__  As new orders keep pouring in , the workers are working three shifts to step up production . __eou__
 I said by the middle of Oct . This is the best we can promise . __eou__  All right . I'll take you at your word . __eou__
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep . __eou__  I promise . __eou__
The order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment . If shipment is too late , we'll have to turn to other suppliers . __eou__  I am sorry , but we can't advance shipment . The manufacturers are fully committed . They have no stock on hand . __eou__
 Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ? __eou__  How's this then ? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready . __eou__
 We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug . __eou__  I agree with your proposal . __eou__
I've come about your wools . According to our market survey , wools are likely to find a ready market in our country . __eou__  Wonderful ! We can meet your requirements and the offer is ready for you . Here it is . The unit price is USD 15.00 per kilogram . __eou__
 It's FOB Shanghai . __eou__  Could you quote the price of CIF Hamburg ? __eou__
 Could you quote the price of CIF Hamburg ? __eou__  Certainly , that's easy . We will work out our CIF offer this evening . Could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 AM ? __eou__
 Certainly , that's easy . We will work out our CIF offer this evening . Could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 AM ? __eou__  Okay , see you tomorrow ! __eou__
 Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . __eou__  You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__
Hey , daughter . Let me ask you something . __eou__  Yes , Dad ? __eou__
 You have children now . What if something , god forbid , happens to you ? __eou__  That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? __eou__
 Yes , I'd like to close my account . __eou__  May I have your name , please ? __eou__
 Next Friday . __eou__  Okay . Where would you like to have your last bill sent to you ? __eou__
 14 May flower Ave , Los Angeles . __eou__  Alright , We'll take care of that . __eou__
Our Afghan customers wanna buy China's tea . I am thinking of placing an order with you . __eou__  Which tea do you prefer , black or jasmine tea ? __eou__
 I like both . Could you show me some samples ? __eou__  Of course , here you are . These are Black tea from Anti , Oolong tea from Guangdong , Oolong tea from Fujisan and Longing tea from Xinu . The new products are Curls Black tea , Crushed Black tea and so on . They are the best sellers in many countries . __eou__
 Oh , such a variety . All of them are excellent both in color and flavour . No wonder our people like China ’ s tea better than any other kind . Could you give me some idea of the prices ? __eou__  Here is our price list . All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation . You can see the prices are reasonable . __eou__
 I'd like you to quote me CIF Karachi . __eou__  Right . Could you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? __eou__
 Right . Could you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? __eou__  Yes . I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti , 200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea , first grade . __eou__
 Good . We will make the offer tomorrow afternoon . Is that all right ? __eou__  Yes . See you tomorrow afternoon . __eou__
 Or would you like us to phone you when the money arrives ? __eou__  That would be very kind of you . __eou__
 Could you please tell me your phone number , so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ? __eou__  The phone number is 328 6765 extension 105 . __eou__
 Yes , but I need to borrow some more money . __eou__  Well . In that case we can offer you a private educational loan . __eou__
 Just fill out this application . We can let you know right away if you qualify . __eou__  All right , thank you ! __eou__
 Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ... __eou__  Just a moment , please . Your name ? __eou__
 Here is your balance . __eou__  Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars . __eou__
 Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars . __eou__  Here you go , Miss . __eou__
I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ? __eou__  I'd be glad to . __eou__
 In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application . __eou__  What is the interest rate on your card ? __eou__
 Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? __eou__  Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you . __eou__
 Well , may I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? I think that will be enough . __eou__  Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ? __eou__
 Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ? __eou__  Ok . __eou__
Put on the helmet , please . __eou__  Do we need to put on the jackets too ? __eou__
 You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step . __eou__  Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ? __eou__
 Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . __eou__  Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . __eou__
 So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . __eou__  We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__
 No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . __eou__  All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . __eou__
 We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__  No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . __eou__
 Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . __eou__  Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . __eou__
I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . __eou__  Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . __eou__
 We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . __eou__  We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... __eou__
 Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . __eou__  Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? __eou__
 Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . __eou__  All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . __eou__
This is our rock - bottom price , Mr . Li . We can't make any further concessions . __eou__  If that's the case , there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . __eou__
 What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . __eou__  I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? __eou__
 I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? __eou__  What is your proposal ? __eou__
 Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally . __eou__  Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible . __eou__
 The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom . __eou__  That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed . __eou__
 That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed . __eou__  You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again . __eou__
 I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting . __eou__  Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up . __eou__
 How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? __eou__  Good . I'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically . __eou__
 I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it . __eou__  We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . __eou__
 As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? __eou__  Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? __eou__
 Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . __eou__  You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown . __eou__
 On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . __eou__  Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ? __eou__
 Tomorrow afternoon . __eou__  Tomorrow afternoon will be fine . __eou__
 Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now . __eou__  Take your time . __eou__
 We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? __eou__  Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . __eou__
 Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . __eou__  The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . __eou__
 The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . __eou__  Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . __eou__
 Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . __eou__  When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . __eou__
 To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . __eou__  Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? __eou__
 I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? __eou__  Very well , I will . __eou__
 As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . __eou__  Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . __eou__
 To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . __eou__  That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . __eou__
 I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . __eou__  Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? __eou__
 Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? __eou__  Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? __eou__
 Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? __eou__  Good . Friday morning at 9 . __eou__
 Yes , I would like to exchange some money . __eou__  what currency would you like to trade in ? __eou__
 I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? __eou__  No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? __eou__
 I'm afraid I can't wait that long . Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ? __eou__  Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ? __eou__
 Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ? __eou__  Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . __eou__
 Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . __eou__  Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out . __eou__
Is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? __eou__  We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? __eou__
 Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? __eou__  I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go . __eou__
 I'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.That is our bottom line . If you can meet that price , you've got the deal.Otherwise ... __eou__  I'll tell you what , I'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what I can do . I can't give you any guarantees . But we can try . __eou__
You got our email with all the specifications for the project . We'll be accepting bids untill noon on Tuesday . If you have any questions between now and then , please let me know . __eou__  Actually , I did have a question . We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project . We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid . But at the same time , we'd like to hit your target price , too . __eou__
 Actually , I did have a question . We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project . We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid . But at the same time , we'd like to hit your target price , too . __eou__  I understand . But unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . We also consider other elements , including design and practicality . We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company . __eou__
 Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time . __eou__  That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional . __eou__
 Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off . __eou__  You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? __eou__
 You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? __eou__  I could , but where's the fun in that ? __eou__
 Well , those are my terms . As long as you honor them , we do business.If you break faith and try to take advantage , I'll find someone else to work with . Can you live with that ? __eou__  No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance . __eou__
 Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? __eou__  I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? __eou__
 I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? __eou__  Sure . No problem . __eou__
 Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? __eou__  Sure . Do you have my number ? __eou__
 Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . __eou__  Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? __eou__
 Well . You ’ Ve come prepared . I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . __eou__  Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . __eou__
 No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__  Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . __eou__
 That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__  Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__
We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? __eou__  Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . __eou__
 Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . __eou__  $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! __eou__
 It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . __eou__  Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . __eou__
 Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . __eou__  No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it . __eou__
 Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? __eou__  No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . __eou__
 So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . __eou__  Great ! __eou__
I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon . __eou__  Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement . __eou__
 Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement . __eou__  Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . __eou__
 Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . __eou__  Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits . __eou__
 Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits . __eou__  Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees . __eou__
 Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees . __eou__  No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ? __eou__
 No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ? __eou__  We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . __eou__
 We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . __eou__  But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit . __eou__
 But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit . __eou__  Done ... __eou__
Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough . __eou__  I think my husband has some . __eou__
 Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you . __eou__  That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself . __eou__
 Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? __eou__  Certainly . __eou__
 Can I have a reduction of seven percent ? __eou__  It depends on how much you order __eou__
 Can I use the FAS terms ? __eou__  I'd rather use the CIF terms.You ' re welcome to come to talk about it in detail with your general manager and sign a contract . __eou__
Do you think I should turn down his offer ? __eou__  Yes , it's the correct thing to do . __eou__
 Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . __eou__  Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? __eou__
 Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . __eou__  Excuse me ? __eou__
 Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . __eou__  What kind of change , just in prices ? __eou__
 No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . __eou__  You mean on product availability , reliability and price ? __eou__
 No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision . __eou__  So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt . __eou__
 I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ? __eou__  I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit . __eou__
 To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost . __eou__  Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__
 Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__  Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__
 Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__  Well , Mrs . Wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round , we pay by L / C for our imports . __eou__
 Well , Mrs . Wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round , we pay by L / C for our imports . __eou__  To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ? __eou__
 To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ? __eou__  I'm very sorry , Mrs . Wang . But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that . As I've said , we require payment by L / C . __eou__
 Sure , what can I do for you ? __eou__  We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know , so we can have the funds put aside . __eou__
Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? __eou__  That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . __eou__
 Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . __eou__  As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . __eou__
 All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . __eou__  You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? __eou__
 Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . __eou__  Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . __eou__
 Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions . __eou__  Exactly . That's what we have done in the past . __eou__
 Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days . __eou__  Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 . __eou__
 Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 . __eou__  Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature . __eou__
Well , Mr . Brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ? __eou__  Many of our business friends in England , France , Switzerland , Italy and Germany are paying for our exports in Japan currency . It is quite easy to do so . __eou__
 Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen . They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service . __eou__  Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ? __eou__
 Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . __eou__  I see . __eou__
To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later . __eou__  Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ? __eou__
 Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__  Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__
 Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit . __eou__  You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C . __eou__
 Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future . __eou__  By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ? __eou__
 By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ? __eou__  Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . __eou__
 Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time . __eou__  All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another two weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect . __eou__
 That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . __eou__  Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look . __eou__
 Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look . __eou__  Sure . __eou__
 Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . __eou__  All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand . __eou__
 All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . __eou__  Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? __eou__
 Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . __eou__  Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . __eou__
Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? __eou__  Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . __eou__
 Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . __eou__  Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . __eou__
 Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__  Why use wooden cases ? __eou__
 Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . __eou__  No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . __eou__
 Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . __eou__  Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . __eou__
 But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . __eou__  If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . __eou__
 If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . __eou__  I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . __eou__
 We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . __eou__  Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . __eou__
 Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . __eou__  Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply . __eou__
Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? __eou__  I don't think we can . __eou__
 By the middle of October , I think . __eou__  That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . __eou__
 Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . __eou__  But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . __eou__
 Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . __eou__  I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . __eou__
 But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us . __eou__  All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say . __eou__
 How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? __eou__  I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . __eou__
 Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . __eou__  It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? __eou__
 It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? __eou__  We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April . __eou__

 Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . __eou__  I can just enter the amount using the key , right ? __eou__

 Good-bye . Miss Li , say hello to your husband and your son for me . See you soon . __eou__  Good-bye , Mr White . A happy journey home , and hope to see you again soon . __eou__
 For over forty years . The original company Davies Engineering - was founded in 1960 by the Davies brothers in a small workshop near Manchester . They closed down the workshop in 1980 and opened up a new factory in Leeds . __eou__  When did it become CABS ? __eou__
 In 1997 - when it was bought by a German company . They set up two more business in the UK . __eou__  What does CABS stand for ? __eou__
 On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation . __eou__  Very good . __eou__
 Very good . __eou__  On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide . __eou__
 You're leaving on Tuesday morning . __eou__  What time exactly ? __eou__
 Your flight takes off at 8 __eou__  Oh , am I seeing Mr . Li ? __eou__
 I've got a schedule ! __eou__  Oh , that's not everything . You're free on Friday and then on Saturday you're catching the 9 o'clock plane back to Guangzhou . __eou__
Bad news , I'm afraid . Our supplier has gone bust . The parts you ordered have arrived at the docks but the handling agent won't release them until someone pays the invoice . We also need to arrange transport to the factory . __eou__  Don't worry about the cost . Our insurance policy covers us against situations like this . We need those parts urgently . Could you please try to get them here tomorrow ? __eou__
 Of course . A two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek . __eou__  Good . Anything else ? __eou__
 You are scheduled to meet Mr . Thompson of ABC Company at eleven this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Li . And this afternoon at four you will attend a press conference . __eou__  I am afraid I can't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the Board of Directors at half past four . __eou__
 I am afraid I can't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the Board of Directors at half past four . __eou__  All right . Do you want me to cancel the reservation for you ? __eou__
 Yes , after you ’ Ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation __eou__  Only three days ? __eou__
 That's the company policy . __eou__  What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ’ m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ? __eou__
 Yes . That's the company policy . __eou__  It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ’ d be different . __eou__
 If you join us , our company will provide you a single dormitory . If you make great achievements , our company will offer you a flat according to the related regulations . It all depends . __eou__  I also want to know if there's a holiday at your company , for I must visit my parents every year . __eou__
 I have been employed as a secretary at a trading company . __eou__  What do you think of your present job ? __eou__
 I find it interesting . __eou__  How do you get to office ? __eou__
 I go to the office by bus every day . __eou__  What does your work consist of exactly ? __eou__
 My main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees . __eou__  Would you mind working overtime at night ? __eou__
 5,000 yuan a month . __eou__  Why do you plan to change your job ? __eou__
You have worked in your present company for five years . __eou__  Yes , I do . __eou__
 Yes , I do . __eou__  Why do you want to resign ? __eou__
 As you know I serve as a secretary in my present company , I really want to look for a more challenging opportunity . __eou__  What kind of work are you interested in ? __eou__
 Just as you advertised in the newspaper . __eou__  So you are interested in our company . __eou__
 So you are interested in our company . __eou__  Yes , what's more , your company is one of the largest and best trading companies in this line of business . __eou__
 Everything's going very well . The first phase of the project was finished three days ahead of schedule . We're on target to complete phase two by the beginning of week 40 . __eou__  That's good news . What stage are you at now ? __eou__
Our new production control program's going live on Monday . The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks . That should give us time to iron out any little problems . __eou__  Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year . __eou__
 Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year . __eou__  Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems . __eou__
 Not quite . The software engineers are testing it just now . __eou__  Have all the operators been trained on it ? __eou__
We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade . But don't worry , it won't cause too much inconvenience . We're going to do it over the weekend . __eou__  How long will the system be down for ? __eou__
 We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday . __eou__  That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side . __eou__
 Three . __eou__  Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? __eou__
 I am in charge of the trading department . I'm handling invoices , shipping bills and computing freight costs , that's most of the documentation . __eou__  What time do you go to work ? __eou__
 I must be there no later than 9:00 . __eou__  What time does the office close ? __eou__
 I quit work whenever I get finished , usually about six o'clock . __eou__  Does your work involve a lot of paper filling and typing ? __eou__
 No , the secretary does this . It's not part of my job . __eou__  What made you decide to change your job ? __eou__
Hi ! Someone has reported a fault on one of your copiers . __eou__  That's right . I'm glad you're here . It hasn't been working properly for the last few days . __eou__
 That's right . I'm glad you're here . It hasn't been working properly for the last few days . __eou__  When was it serviced ? __eou__
 Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable . __eou__  What's actually wrong with it ? __eou__
 Well , it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays . __eou__  I'm sure it's nothing serious , probably just a minor fault . I'll have a look at it . __eou__
We've got very good workshop facilities here . We do all our own servicing and most repairs . We have separate areas for welding , grinding and sawing . __eou__  Is there anything you don't do in-house ? __eou__
 Yes . If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance . __eou__  Is that more expensive ? __eou__
I've just taken a spanner set from the stores . __eou__  That's fine . Don't forget to update the inventory . __eou__
 Just there by the door . I need to measure the length of this workbench . We're going to replace it . OK - 3 m 47 cm . Let's round it up to 3 m 50 . __eou__  I'm glad you're replacing it . We need more space to work on things . How deep will the new workbench be ? __eou__
 It's quite a delicate piece of equipment , so I hope it was well-packed . It's oblong-shaped , about 50 cm long . It's made of metal . __eou__  There's a large wooden crate in the corner which I haven't unpacked yet . It might be in there . __eou__
OK , so this is the main factory area . We're now walking past the printing machine . It's printing in four colours at the moment . __eou__  What's going on over there ? __eou__
 They're setting up the machine for a new run . __eou__  How long does that usually take ? __eou__
 About twenty minutes . __eou__  What's happening at the far end ? __eou__
I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job . __eou__  Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract . __eou__
 It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades , trays etc . - and then sends it back into the system . __eou__  What does the unit consist of ? __eou__
OK , so this is our newest machine . It was only installed last year . __eou__  What's the running speed of the machine ? __eou__
 About 1,500 metres per minute . It's one of the fastest in the world . We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now . __eou__  And what's the maximum output ? __eou__
 Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . __eou__  What about supply of parts to the production line ? __eou__
 Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . __eou__  What about the smaller components ? __eou__
 Well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted . __eou__  So , is it actually paper at this stage ? __eou__
 We try to recycle as much as we can . __eou__  What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ? __eou__
 We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . __eou__  But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? __eou__
 Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . __eou__  What about your use of raw materials ? __eou__
 Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . __eou__  What happens if you exceed the limits ? __eou__
Hello , ABC Company . __eou__  Hello , could I speak to Mr . Wang , please ? __eou__
 Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . __eou__  Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around . __eou__
Good morning , Mr . Smith . Welcome to Wuhan . __eou__  Good morning ! __eou__
 Good morning ! __eou__  Mr . Smith , did you have a good journey ? __eou__
 I just feel a little tired . You know , it took me 16 hours to get here . __eou__  You must take a rest today . __eou__
 We hope your stay here a pleasant one ! __eou__  I believe I will . __eou__
Good afternoon . __eou__  Hello . This is Jones . I'd like to speak to Mr . Chen . __eou__
 Speaking . __eou__  I'd like to discuss the new order with you . Would you like to have lunch together at Garden Hotel next Tuesday ? __eou__
 Yes , I am . __eou__  I'm from Textile Import and Export Corporation . I've come to meet you . My name is Zhang Yong . __eou__
 I'm from Textile Import and Export Corporation . I've come to meet you . My name is Zhang Yong . __eou__  How do you do , Mr . Zhang ? I'm glad to meet you . __eou__
 How do you do , Mr . Zhang ? I'm glad to meet you . __eou__  How do you do , Mr . Smith ? Let me help you with your luggage . __eou__
 On the whole , not too bad . __eou__  Anyhow , it's a long way to China , isn't it ? And I think you must be very tired . __eou__
 Yes , I am , rather . But I'll be all right by tomorrow and ready for business . __eou__  I wish you a pleasant stay here . __eou__
 I wish you a pleasant stay here . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Now , Mr . Smith , if all is ready , we'd better start for the hotel . __eou__
 The meeting was delayed by thirty minutes and it lasted for two and a half hours . __eou__  Did the chairman ask for me ? __eou__
 Yes , I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend . __eou__  All right . Have you handed in my report to him ? __eou__
 Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting . __eou__  What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ? __eou__
 First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed . __eou__  I see , and how about the documents and the information ? __eou__
 All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting . __eou__  And what should a secretary do during the meeting ? __eou__
 Of course , she should take minutes . __eou__  And after the meeting ? __eou__
 After the meeting she should type the minutes up , and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting . __eou__  It's seriously good . __eou__
 Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws , bolts , nuts , pins , studs , and that kind of things . __eou__  For wood or for metal ? __eou__
 Yes , quite free until noon . __eou__  Fine . Then , shall we go right away ? I have a car outside . __eou__
Mr . Li , the report has been finished . __eou__  So fast ! Thank you . __eou__
 So fast ! Thank you . __eou__  You're welcome . This is my duty . Anything else ? __eou__
Owl ! I've twisted my ankle . I slipped on that greasy patch over there . I don't think it's broken but it really hurts . __eou__  Sit down here - don't put any pressure on it . I'd better call the company doctor . __eou__
 We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on . They are all phosphate-free , which minimises damage to the environment . __eou__  What about the packaging ? __eou__
Your hand is bleeding . What have you done to it ? __eou__  I cut it on that blade . __eou__
 I cut it on that blade . __eou__  I'll get the first aid box . There's some antiseptic cream and a bandage in there . __eou__
 Yes , it's definitely a growing business . __eou__  What do you recycle in your plant ? __eou__
 Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . __eou__  How is plastic recycled , then ? __eou__
 Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . __eou__  Is that the method you use here ? __eou__
 No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products . __eou__  How do you do that ? __eou__
Caroline Menzies speaking . __eou__  Could I speak to Diana Curzon ? __eou__
 This is John Laing from Dantons . __eou__  Can I take a message , Mr Laing ? __eou__
 She must have , but let me give it to you anyway . It's 01705 455623 . __eou__  01705 ... __eou__
 01705 ... __eou__  455623 . __eou__
 455623 . __eou__  455623 . __eou__
 455623 . __eou__  That's right . __eou__
 That's right . __eou__  OK . I'll make sure she gets the message . __eou__
 OK . I'll make sure she gets the message . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
Rebecca Johnson speaking . __eou__  I'd like to speak to someone in your Accounts Department , please . __eou__
 Yes , please . My name's Michael Caxton from one of your customers — Rosedale Investments . __eou__  Sorry , just a moment . The name is Caxton ... __eou__
 Sorry , just a moment . The name is Caxton ... __eou__  No , it's Caxton . __eou__
 Rosedale Investments . __eou__  Could you spell that , please ? __eou__
 It's R , O , S , E , D , A , L , E . __eou__  Thank you . And the message ? __eou__
 It's about an invoice which is wrong . __eou__  Have you got the number there ? __eou__
 Um ... yes ... it's 856674 / ros . __eou__  856674 . __eou__
 856674 . __eou__  That's right . __eou__
 That's right . __eou__  OK , I'll get someone to phone you first thing in the morning . __eou__
Marriott Street . __eou__  How do you spell that ? __eou__
 M , A , double R , I , O , double T . __eou__  Right . Got that . __eou__
 Of course . It's H , O , R , S , T , then W , E , I , S , S , M , U umlaut , L , L , E , R . __eou__  Right , I think I've got that . OK , what's the message ? __eou__
It's the Cygnet Trust . __eou__  Could you spell that please ? __eou__
 Of course . C , Y , G , N , E , T . __eou__  Cygnet . OK , I've got that . __eou__
This is our main service area . We do all the routine services here and have two full-time mechanics . __eou__  How often do you service the vans ? __eou__
 They're serviced regularly . We give them a basic service every 10,000 km or so and a main service once a year , or every 100,000 km . __eou__  I see . What does the service involve ? __eou__
 Well , the same as for private vehicles really , but we do it more often because they get a lot of wear and tear . __eou__  Can you carry out major repairs here ? __eou__
 I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance . __eou__  We need to establish routine maintenance procedures . It costs us too much in lost production if we wait until something breaks down before we fix it . __eou__
 We take very good care of this particular pump . It's a crucial part of our process . We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month . __eou__  How do you decide how often these things need to be done ? __eou__
 There's no power . __eou__  Have you checked the fuse box ? __eou__
 Yes , the fuse had blown and I've changed it but now the motor keeps cutting out . __eou__  There might be a loose connection somewhere that's making the safety switch trip . Check the settings on the trip-switch . If you can't fix it yourself , call in an electrician . __eou__
 The toner has run out and there's none in the stationery cupboard . __eou__  I need to make six copies of this report for the Board Meeting tomorrow . Ring Office Supplies and ask if they have any in stock . If they can't deliver this afternoon , I'll go and collect it . __eou__
 I think the gears have seized up __eou__  You'll have to dismantle the unit and lubricate the bearings . Do it as quickly as you can but make sure you top up the oil before you start the motor up again . __eou__
 Yes , that's right . I like this city very much and would like to make my home here . __eou__  Here is an application . Please fill it out to the best of your ability . Did you bring a resume and references ? __eou__
I have some great news ! I was able to switch to the night shift ! __eou__  I knew everything would work out for you ! __eou__
 I knew everything would work out for you ! __eou__  I got to meet the night Anger today too . We got along right from the start . __eou__
 I got to meet the night Anger today too . We got along right from the start . __eou__  Wonderful ! Do you already have your work schedule ? __eou__
 Not yet , I pick it up tomorrow . __eou__  Do you know what you will be doing yet ? __eou__
 Yes , I'll be managing the guys on the dock . __eou__  You're so good with people . I think they will like you ! __eou__
Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ... __eou__  You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous . __eou__
 You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous . __eou__  Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while . __eou__
 Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising . __eou__  Well , that's kind of obvious . __eou__
 Well , that's kind of obvious . __eou__  Give me a break , Mr Yang . __eou__
Hello ! You're welcome to Guangzhou Fair . __eou__  Thank you . I'm from America . Here is my business card . __eou__
 Glad to meet you , Mr . Smith . My name is Wang and here is my name card . I'll be glad to do what I can for you . __eou__  Great ! This is my first visit to the Fair . Everything is new to me . Would you please give me some information ? __eou__
 I'm in the electrical appliances . __eou__  I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company . __eou__
 Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation . __eou__  Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ? __eou__
We are interested in some precision machine tools . We have some inquires on hand . __eou__  That's fine . We can supply all kinds of precision machine tools . Our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry . __eou__
 That's fine . We can supply all kinds of precision machine tools . Our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry . __eou__  Can I have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data ? __eou__
 I think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high , compared with those of other supplies . __eou__  Excuse me . It's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers , but It's only due to our technological superiority . __eou__
 Excuse me . It's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers , but It's only due to our technological superiority . __eou__  Your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff . __eou__
 Your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff . __eou__  If you give us your inquiry , I shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms . __eou__
Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me . __eou__  Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 . __eou__
 The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company . __eou__  Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind . __eou__
 Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind . __eou__  In my opinion , a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you . This is the filing cabinet and any document or file you may need . And you should file these documents in alphabetical order . __eou__
I heard Nick found a job in a bank and his salary is said very high . I also want to work there . __eou__  Will this do ? Your major is not related to banking , as you know . __eou__
 I know that , but making a lot of money makes me crazy . __eou__  Money is not the only standard to decide your career . In fact , there are more important things you can refer to when evaluating your career . If I were you , I would choose one I like to do . __eou__
 Actually , I am afraid I will be stuck in the job forever , if I choose a bad one . __eou__  Don't worry . We can always change our careers , when we are unsatisfied with them . __eou__
 For most of the articles in the catalog , we have good supply . __eou__  Here's our inquiry list . You'll find the required items , specifications and quantities all there . __eou__
 I don't need to remind you that the market has become very competitive . __eou__  You'll find our prices very favorable . __eou__
 You'll find our prices very favorable . __eou__  That's fine . By the way , do you quote FOB or CIF ? __eou__
 Either can be done , though we usually quote on CIF basis . __eou__  Then would you please make your prices CIF including five percent ? __eou__
 This is our counter-offer . __eou__  We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . __eou__
 Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? __eou__  Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . __eou__
 Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . __eou__  I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . __eou__
 I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . __eou__  I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . __eou__
 I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . __eou__  I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . __eou__
I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting A-l quality . __eou__  I've looked at your units , and am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality . __eou__
 I've looked at your units , and am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality . __eou__  We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We won't sacrifice quality for quick profits . __eou__
 We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We won't sacrifice quality for quick profits . __eou__  Well , we're really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want . __eou__
 One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . __eou__  But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . __eou__
 But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . __eou__  We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made . __eou__
 We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made . __eou__  Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? __eou__
 I still have no idea what to do now . __eou__  Don't act like this . Please have good thoughts in your mind . What's behind you ? __eou__
 I could not agree with you more . But I feel worried about what to do next as soon as I begin to write my resume . __eou__  There is no need to do like this . We can surf the net and find some templates for resume . __eou__
 I sent my resume to a computer company and am waiting for their call . __eou__  Which company ? __eou__
 Yep ! I got some , in which I am interested . But ... __eou__  But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties . __eou__
 No . It isn't . __eou__  OK . Try closing down all the files you're not using at the moment . __eou__
 Yes , but nothing's happened . __eou__  OK , you ’ ll need to reboot your machine . Press Control , Alt and Delete at the same time . __eou__
I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me . __eou__  Are you sure you're using the right program ? __eou__
 Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours . __eou__  That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file . __eou__
The system keeps crashing when I try to access the personnel database . __eou__  I think the file is too big . You'll need to expand your memory . First , close down all the files you have open , and then ... __eou__
 Yes , it is . As you know , some of the materials we use are highly-flammable so we have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory . __eou__  What does that sign mean ? __eou__
I ’ Ve been having problems getting onto the Internet . __eou__  Have you checked your connection settings ? __eou__
 Yes , they're fine . I suppose.the server might be down again . __eou__  Yes , there have been a few problems recently . Why don't you call the IT department ? __eou__
 It's very good , and the result isn't too bad . __eou__  Really ? __eou__

 I passed College English Test Band 6 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading , and writing .

I think practically , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I am quite familiar with Microsoft Office . __eou__  What else do you have to prove your English ability ? __eou__
 I took a part-time job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . My work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors , communicating with them , arranging their agenda , and translating several materials .

 Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries .

Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy . __eou__  How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? __eou__
 I can write computer programs , I have a good command of secretarial skills . __eou__  What qualifications have you got ? __eou__
 I have a doctor license and a driving license . __eou__  Do you get special training in office skills ? __eou__
 I passed both the Cambridge Examinations ( First Certificate and the Certificate of Proficiency in English ); and studied for a year in London at the Lucas Secretarial College , ending with speeds of 120 words per minute in English shorthand and 50 words per minute in typing . I was also trained in office procedure . __eou__  Please tell me about work you have done , which qualifies you for this job . __eou__
 We're going to pay by check . __eou__  Will you please have the check certified ? __eou__
 It's just our policy . We would accept a certified check or a direct bank remittance . __eou__  OK , no problem . __eou__
 As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies . __eou__  What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ? __eou__
 Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world . __eou__  What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ? __eou__
 Well , he looked sharp and he came across as a very confident guy . __eou__  Okay , what about the first woman ? __eou__
 She looked a little rough around the edges but had great skills . __eou__  All right , and what about the older gentle ? __eou__
 He was very distinguished , maybe a bit over-qualified . __eou__  Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job . __eou__
 Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job . __eou__  Why don't you go over the resumes again ? They might help you decide who to hire . __eou__
 Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others . __eou__  What ’ s your ideal job ? __eou__
 Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . __eou__  How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ? __eou__
 Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best . __eou__  How would your present boss describe you ? __eou__
 He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience . __eou__  What would your colleagues say about you ? __eou__
 Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person . __eou__  Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ? __eou__
 No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going . __eou__  What's your strong points ? __eou__
 Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks . __eou__  What do you dislike most about your job ? __eou__
 Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility . __eou__  What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ? __eou__
 A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question . __eou__  Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ? __eou__
 Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . __eou__  How do you feel about overtime work ? __eou__
 That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done . __eou__  What is most important to you in a job ? __eou__
 I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work . __eou__  Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__
 I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing . __eou__  Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ? __eou__
 Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy . __eou__  OK . What are your strong points ? __eou__
 Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point . __eou__  And your weaknesses ? __eou__

 I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals . __eou__  What do you think is important in your work ? __eou__
 Yes , we're ready to start the invitation to tender . You're well informed . We'd like to build new factory . __eou__  When do you open the tender ? And where ? __eou__

 Yes , I did like Spanish and Music . But I don't remember much Spanish . __eou__  That's too bad . We could really use someone who is bilingual . __eou__
 Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . __eou__  Could you tell me something about your English education ? __eou__
 I studied English in junior and senior high school . And in college , I took English conversation lessons . They were given by foreign tutors . __eou__  Have you passed College English Test Band 4 or Band 6 ? __eou__
 Band 6 . __eou__  Great . Can you file in English ? __eou__
 I ’ m afraid I can ’ t , but I'd be glad to learn . __eou__  You would be using a lot of English in this job . Can you manage English conversation ? __eou__

 I ’ Ve only find a few openings in my field . __eou__  There ’ s not a very high demand for that kind of job , isn ’ t there ? __eou__
 Unfortunately not . If I can ’ t find anything in that field , then I could also work in the marketing field . __eou__  That ’ s a good idea . You have plenty of experience in marketing , don ’ t you ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  By the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . __eou__
 It is a job at an advertisement company . __eou__  Do you think they'd hire me ? __eou__
 It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . __eou__  We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? __eou__
 We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? __eou__  Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies . __eou__
 The significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . Despite many countries accession to TO membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . However , these frictions will be better managed under the TO trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism . __eou__  In spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 __eou__
 In spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 __eou__  Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . For this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise . The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive . __eou__

The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive . __eou__  How can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ? __eou__
 Yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country . __eou__  As you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in Asia . What is the current legal framework in the countries ? __eou__
 The lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . However , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . This will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues . __eou__  Several years ago , the countries and China singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years . __eou__
 Several years ago , the countries and China singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years . __eou__  Precisely , the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with TO agreement . __eou__
 Yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . __eou__  I agree with you there , but you price is unreasonable . __eou__
 I agree with you there , but you price is unreasonable . __eou__  I don't think so . You must compare our price with that it other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . __eou__
 I don't think so . You must compare our price with that it other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . __eou__  I don't think we will be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . __eou__
 The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . __eou__  Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . __eou__
 Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . __eou__
 I think my greatest accomplishment has been acquiring the Hans account . __eou__  That certainly is quite an accomplishment . __eou__
 That certainly is quite an accomplishment . __eou__  Yes , it took a year and a lot of initiative to get that account . __eou__
 Yes , it took a year and a lot of initiative to get that account . __eou__  What's your sales record been like there ? __eou__
 The last two years we have seen an increase in sales of about 30 % to 40 % each year , so I ’ m very pleased . And our sales projections are quite good for the next two years . __eou__  If things are going so well , why do you want to leave the firm now ? __eou__
How do you do , Mr . Johnson ? I'm Thomas . __eou__  How do you do ? __eou__
 How do you do ? __eou__  I'm coming for the job you've advertised in yesterday's newspaper . __eou__
 I'm coming for the job you've advertised in yesterday's newspaper . __eou__  OK . What's your working experience ? __eou__
 I have worked for IBM for three years . __eou__  How do your experiences benefit our company ? __eou__
 I know the marketing from top to bottom and I can develop a new market for you . __eou__  Are you aware of the aspects of this position and do you feel you are qualified ? __eou__
 Yes , I understand my qualification and your needs by researching your company . __eou__  If you enter this company , what section would you like to work in ? __eou__
 Let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st . __eou__  Right . We couldn't handle much larger shipments . __eou__
 Right . We couldn't handle much larger shipments . __eou__  Fine . But I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1000 units , the next 2000 . The 31 st is quite soon , I can't guarantee 1500 . __eou__
 It certainly is . __eou__  Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly . __eou__
 That's right . __eou__  Have you brought your credentials ? __eou__
 Yes , here you are . __eou__  Let me have a look . __eou__
 I was responsible for sales . __eou__  Have you received any honorable title personally ? __eou__
 Yes , I was twice singled out as an ' Advanced Worker ' . __eou__  Well , considering your qualifications , we believe you would be a suitable candidate . __eou__
 All right . In my first teaching position I received the ' Excellent Teaching ' award the past two years in succession . __eou__  Have you received any other honors ? __eou__
 Yes . I was chosen as one of ' the Top Prominent Youths of Beijing ' __eou__  Do you have anything published ? __eou__
 It is because of the quality . __eou__  Could you tell me the particulars ? __eou__
 Yes , I do . __eou__  The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard . __eou__
 The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard . __eou__  Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified . __eou__
 It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country . __eou__  Why does the government levy the tariff ? __eou__
 Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue . __eou__  Anything else . __eou__
 Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods . __eou__  Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang . __eou__
 Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang . __eou__  Do not mention it . __eou__
 No , thank you . That will be all for now . __eou__  Your document will be ready in about ten minutes . __eou__
 Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports . __eou__  Can you give an example ? __eou__
 For example , some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 This is used to protect local industries or to achieve certain political objectives . __eou__  Oh , Are there other means ? __eou__
 Technical barriers are set for imported goods . __eou__  This is designed to exclude them from domestic market , isn't it ? __eou__
 Working for your company ! As the top administrative assistant in your firm ! __eou__  Good answer , Miss Zhang-good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ? __eou__
 Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . If the company is happy with my work , then , I think I would like to consider other positions in the company . __eou__  Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? __eou__
 I wouldn't call myself introverted . Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times I like sharing activities with others too . __eou__  What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__
 Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don ’ t like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous . I can ’ t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . __eou__  What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? __eou__
 For me , this would be having good relationships with my family members . My family has always been very close knit , and we still spend a lot of time together . __eou__  What basic principles do you apply to your life ? __eou__
 I think I ’ m tough not only physically but mentally . __eou__  Why do you say that ? __eou__
 I have been playing football since high school . At present , I ’ m a member of a community football club . __eou__  Really ? Are you still playing ? __eou__
 Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates . __eou__  I see . You must be tough . __eou__
 I see . You must be tough . __eou__  I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football . __eou__
 I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football . __eou__  What do you consider to be your weak points ? __eou__
 Frankly speaking , I ’ m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ’ t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late . __eou__  What kind of people are you reluctant to work with ? __eou__
 So far I haven ’ t met any particular kind . However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working . __eou__  Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ? __eou__
 I wouldn't call myself outgoing . I used to be very shy when I was little , and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year , and have more fun in groups . __eou__  Are you more of a follower or a leader ? __eou__
 I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together . __eou__  What basic principles do you apply to your life ? __eou__
 Let me check - - oh , here it is . It just arrived a few minutes ago . __eou__  Excellent . I have been expecting it . __eou__
 Excellent . I have been expecting it . __eou__  Is it important ? __eou__
 You bet it is . It's about the new contract . __eou__  Here it is , sir . __eou__
 Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization . __eou__  Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ? __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  Here is the agenda for the meeting and that's all for the messages . __eou__
 I allocate different patients with their consent to different nurses . And I supervise the primary nurses and help nurses carry out their work . __eou__  How to maintain a high standard of nursing ? __eou__
 Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse . __eou__  How about your nursing education ? __eou__
 I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School . __eou__  Can you manage English conversation ? __eou__
 Yes , I have been working in the Public Relations Section of a company in the past two years . I plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent . __eou__  Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? __eou__
 Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company . __eou__  Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? __eou__
 Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . __eou__  Have you had any experience with computer ? __eou__
 Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer . __eou__  That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ? __eou__
 I can handle them without any trouble __eou__  What have you learned from jobs you have held ? __eou__
 Above all , I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed . __eou__  Very good . __eou__
 My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis . __eou__  What had you gained mainly from this survey activity ? __eou__
 That's right . I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores . __eou__  Well , experience is not important in this job . We are looking for a man we can train to be a teller . By the way , do you like to work with figures ? __eou__
 Yes , I liked math in school . __eou__  We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . Do you like meeting the public ? __eou__
 Yes , I enjoy working with people . __eou__  We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with . You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . He would be responsible for training you . Have you studied English conversation ? __eou__
 Yes , I had an American tutor for two years . I had two lessons under her every week . Would I be using English every day is this job ? __eou__  Yes , many of our customers are Americans , so you would be speaking English with most of them . Do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts ? __eou__
 No , I'm afraid I don't . I'd be glad to learn . __eou__  That's good answer . I appreciate your being frank . __eou__
How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane . __eou__  How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . __eou__
 How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . __eou__  Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . __eou__
 Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . __eou__  Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . __eou__
 Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . __eou__  I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . __eou__
 As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . __eou__  5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . __eou__
 This is our counter-offer . __eou__  We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . __eou__
I had a look yesterday . I found some exhibits are fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I have gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I have got some idea of your exports . I am interested in your silk blouses . __eou__  Our silks are known for their quality . They are one of our traditional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed . They are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand . __eou__
 Our silks are known for their quality . They are one of our traditional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed .

 I will give you the lowest price in the future . __eou__  Thank you ! __eou__
Thank you . I'm very glad to be here . As Ms . Tina said , the purpose of my presentation today is to familiarize you with the new EBB . As you probably know , EBB stands for Electronic Book Player . Our company put the original EBB on the market a year ago , but we have since all developed an improved model which we believe will be a big seller in both China and the U . S . __eou__  Ms . Yang , can you tell us in what ways the new EBB is better than the old model ? __eou__
 Certainly . First of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . So on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and ... __eou__  Excuse me , but what are the Mbps mainly used for ? __eou__
 Oh , there are many uses and I'll explain them in detail a little later . First , I'd like to ... __eou__  Before you go on , Ms Yang , could you tell us if the original EBB sold well in the U . S . ? __eou__

 I think you probably know China has adopted a flexible policy in her foreign trade . __eou__  Yes , I have read about it , but I would like to know more about it . __eou__
 Well , as a rule , the contract will become void automatically , if both sides do not agree to renew it when time comes . __eou__  I got it , but nevertheless . what I was saying just now was that how to terminate the contract before its term's up ? __eou__
 I know how to use the telex machine , the photocopier , and the word processor . By the way , I took a computer course in university . __eou__  Where do you want to be in five years ? __eou__
 I want to be a manager . __eou__  Very good . Any questions ? __eou__
 Well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that I think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person . __eou__  Where do you see yourself three years from now ? __eou__
 I wouldn't like to hold a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . __eou__  That sounds reasonable . __eou__
 That sounds reasonable . __eou__  It's the most important thing to me . __eou__
 It's the most important thing to me . __eou__  Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? __eou__
 I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important , and I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss . __eou__  You'll have a definite answer from us within a week . Goodbye . __eou__
 I want to be in a higher managerial position in the field of international marketing . I ’ m very interested in the European market hopefully , in Brussels . __eou__  Why do you think so ? __eou__
 It ’ s truly exciting to work in newly emerging unified market . Brussels will be center of the new market in the continent . __eou__  What are you looking for in your next job ? __eou__

 No , I haven ’ t had any professional experience , but I have always been interested in creative writing . __eou__  Have you ever had a foreign instructor in English composition ? __eou__
 Yes , my college teacher was an Australian . She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper . I was the editor for two years . __eou__  That ’ s very interesting . Tell me what you did exactly . __eou__
 Well , I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . I wrote the editorial each time . __eou__  What is your aim in going into the field of journalism ? __eou__
 To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day . __eou__  That can be a rough job , you know . __eou__
 That can be a rough job , you know . __eou__  Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing . __eou__
 Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing . __eou__  Well , working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you . What do you think ? __eou__
 I would be glad to do routine work sometimes , if I could be assured of making advancements in the future . __eou__  I think this type of position would be a very good start for you . I am quite sure we can work something out for you , but I cannot give you a definite answer today . We will let you know within just a few days . __eou__
Good morning ! I am a rookie in our office . __eou__  Good morning ! Welcome to our office ! __eou__
 Good morning ! Welcome to our office ! __eou__  Nice to meet you ! My name is Peter Smith . __eou__
 Nice to meet you ! My name is Peter Smith . __eou__  Nice to meet you too ! I am George Williams . __eou__
 Nice to meet you too ! I am George Williams . __eou__  This is my first day at work ! __eou__
 This is my first day at work ! __eou__  Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! __eou__
 Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! __eou__  I am new to the work and I will appreciate your guidance ! __eou__
 Thank you . It is very kind of you . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 Let me see , I would like to work my way up to a senior management position with a company such as yours . __eou__  Great ! It sounds like you might be a good fit . As you know , we ’ re one of the largest brokerage houses in the world . Our daily work is quite hectic , and we , re looking for an assistant who can keep us organized ... help keep the engines running smoothly , so to speak . Our hours are long , but the overtime pay is good ... sort of makes up for the long hours . __eou__
 Great ! It sounds like you might be a good fit . As you know , we ’ re one of the largest brokerage houses in the world . Our daily work is quite hectic , and we , re looking for an assistant who can keep us organized ... help keep the engines running smoothly , so to speak . Our hours are long , but the overtime pay is good ... sort of makes up for the long hours . __eou__  What would a typical day be like for me here ? __eou__
 Well , that ’ s the problem . We never seem to have ' typical ' days , but you'd spend about 30 % of your time on the computer . There would also be a lot of telephone time , setting up appointment , and taking care of a lot of support work . __eou__  Oh , yes , I do . My present job is similar in that respect , and I think I ’ m doing a good job . __eou__
 Yes , the main stockholder is International Business Machines Corporation , namely , IBM for short . __eou__  What section would you like to work in if you enter this company ? __eou__
 I wish to work in the planning department . __eou__  What type of work will you expect to do at first ? __eou__
 I expect to operate computers . __eou__  What are your plans for the future ? __eou__
 I wish to move up to higher positions with acquisition of more experience in the future . __eou__  How long does it take to get here from your home ? __eou__
 It's a twenty-minute bus ride . __eou__  How long do you think that we can depend on your working here ? __eou__
 I ’ ll work here as long as you expect me to . __eou__  You are single now , but what will you do when you get married ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve thought about that a lot . I know that many women take a job , planning to make a career of it , and then they change their mind . But I am hoping to make it my lifetime work . So if I get married , I will find some ways that I can continue my work . __eou__  Do you think you will want to continue working here even after you ’ Ve had a child ? __eou__
 I think so . __eou__  What ideas do you have if we employ you ? __eou__
 Ever since I was a young girl , I ’ Ve been clever with my hands . I ’ Ve always enjoyed doing detailed work . If I could use that ability to make your products a little better and to benefit the company , I would be happy . __eou__  Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? __eou__
 No , nothing in particular . __eou__  If you are employed by us , how are you going to do your part of the work ? __eou__
 I'll first get further information about our goals , ways , counterparts and management , etc . . Then I ’ ll make my plan . And then I ’ ll go with all my effort to see it is realized . __eou__  If you fail to do your work well , what are you going to do ? __eou__
 I ’ ll report it honestly . I ’ ll give a correct analysis . I may quit the job - and pay compensation . But I have my way to judge whether I fail . __eou__  What do you think if you do not have much spare time on this job ? __eou__
 People are supposed to work hard within regular work time , especially when it is an important work that is highly paid for . I don ’ t mind work over spare time if it is paid for . __eou__  What are your expectations from working on this job ? __eou__
 Getting more experience with a widely-known company like yours . Using my speciality in marketing and management . And getting advancement in salary and position . Show my enterprise , confidence and character in passing . __eou__  If you were choosing a person for this job , what kind of individual would you select ? __eou__
 I would select the individual that has the most qualifications among all the applicants . He doesn ’ t have to be the person if we have to fill the vacancy . But he has to be the best , even if we have to pay him higher . __eou__  If we do not employ you , what are you going to do ? __eou__
Mr . Smith just called me back . __eou__  So ? __eou__
 So ? __eou__  We got the contract ! __eou__
 We got the contract ! __eou__  All right ! __eou__
 For the job . __eou__  Good , which job is that ? We advertised several openings . __eou__
 So you're a headhunter . __eou__  We're an Employment Agency . __eou__
 They turned me down . __eou__  Why ? You are so excellent . __eou__
 I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to . __eou__  What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them ! __eou__
 What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them ! __eou__  It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies . __eou__
 It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies . __eou__  I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet . __eou__
 That's the one . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 You were right . It was from a headhunter . She wouldn't tell me anything without a contract . __eou__  Well , no surprise there . __eou__
 Well , no surprise there . __eou__  No ! Not at all . But , I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work . __eou__
 No ! Not at all . But , I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work . __eou__  Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? __eou__
 I'm going there tomorrow . __eou__  Great . Good luck . __eou__
 My name is B . How are you , Miss Kelly ? __eou__  I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . __eou__
 I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute . __eou__  Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ? __eou__
 I ’ m sorry . She ’ s in a meeting right now . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 I see . __eou__  Can I give her a message for you ? __eou__
 Silly me . __eou__  Now press this button . __eou__

 My name is Du Tao , number 3 . __eou__  Pardon ? __eou__
 Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao . __eou__  Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ? __eou__
 I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ’ m 20 years old now . __eou__  Where do you live ? __eou__
 I ’ m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U . __eou__  Can you leave me your phone number ? __eou__
 I think my English is fairly good . As you can see from my CV , I graduated from university with a B . A . degree in English . I studied the English language and English literature systematically . __eou__  How are your typing and shorthand skills ? __eou__
 There are 3 secretarial categories here . One is receptionist , one is junior secretary , and the other is senior secretary . __eou__  What sort of duties do you expect ? __eou__
I've been at this for two weeks now and nothing ’ s turned up . __eou__  You're right . I think it ’ s time to seek professional help . __eou__
 Ha , ha , ha ! I agree . That ’ s not much fun . __eou__  Do you have anyone in mind ? __eou__
 Actually I do . __eou__  Who ? __eou__
 Yes , our employees are allowed to take up 2 days a month to attend college courses . __eou__  That's very generous . __eou__
 That's very generous . __eou__  I've enjoyed the conversation with you . We'll call you within 5 working days . __eou__
Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . __eou__  Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place , one machine instead of three . __eou__
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place , one machine instead of three . __eou__  Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__
 Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__  When will we get one of those ? __eou__
 About one week . __eou__  I really appreciate your time and help . See you then . __eou__
 Yes , I think I speak English quite fluently . I've often explained historical places in Xi'an to foreign tourists in English . They say my English is quite good . __eou__  How many years have you been learning English ? __eou__
 Oh , more than ten years . I started learning English when I was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher . __eou__  Well , perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it . __eou__
 Well , perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it . __eou__  Certainly . __eou__
 I am quite alive and energetic . I am a curious person , and I like to learn new things . __eou__  Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__
 I am quite outgoing , I think . __eou__  How do you get along with people whose characters are different from your own ? __eou__
 I'll go and quit my job in the ABC Company . __eou__  Can you start on Monday ? __eou__
 Hi , I am sorry to say that your experience doesn't fit the job at all . __eou__  Sorry to hear that , but could you inform me why I failed ? __eou__
 Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . __eou__  It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . __eou__
I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . __eou__  It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . __eou__
 It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . __eou__  Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . __eou__
 Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . __eou__  Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . __eou__
 We have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences . __eou__  Experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ? __eou__
 Let me check . It has a paper jam . __eou__  I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Hao . I am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee . Sorry . __eou__  Although I am a little shocked , I can deal with it pretty well . I didn't perform as well as I should have in the interview . __eou__
 Although I am a little shocked , I can deal with it pretty well . I didn't perform as well as I should have in the interview . __eou__  Maybe . But you should not withdraw forever just because you failed once . __eou__
I am sorry to tell you that you failed in the job interview in our company . __eou__  It is tough to accept it , I mean . But can you tell me why ? __eou__
 It is hard to tell . Maybe it is because you're not resourceful enough to be a manager . __eou__  I get it , and thank you for your honesty . __eou__
 Yes , speaking . __eou__  I'd like to tell you that you could come to work with us . __eou__
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__  So you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . __eou__  Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? __eou__
 Thank you . Here is a copy of the Tour Guide Certificate of mine . __eou__  Are you still working in Youth International Travel Agency ? __eou__
 Yes , but I am on holidays this week . __eou__  How many foreign languages can you speak ? __eou__
 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . __eou__  Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? __eou__
 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . __eou__  I didn ’ t pay attention to that . __eou__
 They are reports of our company . __eou__  Are they filed alphabetically ? __eou__
 No , they are filed according to dates . __eou__  Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? __eou__
 Yes . I have published some articles in China Daily and Economist . __eou__  How about your communication skills ? __eou__
 We have a team to make itineraries of the tour , evaluate the value of it for one tourist and recommend the routine for different tourists . __eou__  Can you name a few examples ? __eou__
 As a reporter , he must have acute insight and language skills . At the same time , he must have good judgment , the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others . __eou__  Can you work under pressure ? You know , people working here are all busy everyday since we're daily newspaper . __eou__
 I see . __eou__  Try to be natural , alert and interested . __eou__
 Hello , Mr . Jones , its ... __eou__  Yang Tang , just call me Fred ! Everyone does . __eou__
 Well , I ... I guess the weather . And the people . They were all very friendly to me . __eou__  Yeah , the people are quite relaxed ... Those were some great times I spent there . Well , thanks for stopping by . Are you from King Dao , Yang Tang ? __eou__
 Yes , I am . I was born here , and still live with my parents in the same house . __eou__  Is that right ? Wonderful , wonderful . I've been in King Dao for two years now . A great place . Nice people and great beer ! Well , I guess we ’ d better get started . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ m here for an interview as requested . __eou__  You are Miss Liu ? __eou__
 That ’ s right . __eou__  Please take a seat . __eou__
 I'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone . __eou__  Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__
 I'm quite outgoing , I think . __eou__  Are you more of a follower or a leader ? __eou__
 I read or go swimming , go shopping , usually . I run or play tennis or do something else like those to get some exercises to keep fit . __eou__  Are you introverted or extroverted ? __eou__
 I wouldn't call myself extroverted . Sometimes , I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times , I like sharing activities with others too , especially during these last few years . __eou__  What kinds of sports do you like ? __eou__
 I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing . __eou__  What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__
Hello , Lucy , I heard you did a good deal in interview . __eou__  It's OK . __eou__
 It's OK . __eou__  What did you do in the interview ? __eou__
 I observed the interviewer's manner , mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine . __eou__  Are all these helpful for the interview ? __eou__
 I majored in Public Relations . __eou__  Have you done any work in this field ? __eou__
 Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year . __eou__  What section did you work in ? __eou__
 The export Business Section . __eou__  So you must be very familiar with export procedures . __eou__
 Yes , very much . __eou__  That's good . __eou__
 My chief interest is swimming and climbing with my friends . __eou__  What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? __eou__
 I think that the most important thing is you can ’ t live all by himself . It takes a lot of people working and cooperating together . The more really close friends I have , the better . __eou__  There is a reason in what you say . __eou__
 Teachers are just directors who give scope to the students ' initiative and creativeness , instead of taking their rights away from speaking . __eou__  What did you do to put it into practice ? __eou__
 It's a job I've been dreaming of since I was very little . I firmly believe that teaching is one of the most honorable jobs in the world . __eou__  In what department do you wish to work if we hire you ? __eou__
 Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click . __eou__  I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__
 Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__  Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__
 Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__  Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__
 Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__  But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__
 But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__  Well , keep a low profile . __eou__
 I can confidently say that my Chinese and English are pretty good . I won prizes in many speech contests in both Chinese and English . __eou__  How would you consider your salary if you succeed in becoming a translator in our company ? __eou__
 This job is more challenging and I have longed to be a translator . That ’ s why I came here for an interview . __eou__  What do you think are the capacities for a success as a translator ? __eou__
Brian , a company called me for an interview . __eou__  That's great ! You need to prepare for it . __eou__
 Yes , I worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl . __eou__  What kind of work are you doing now ? __eou__
 I'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company . __eou__  Where are you working ? __eou__
 My name is Zhang Due . __eou__  Would you tell me what education background you have ? __eou__
 I graduated from Beijing College of Foreign Trade . My major was International Trade . __eou__  Do you have any experience in this field ? __eou__
 Yes , I have been working in Lush Insurance Company for four years . __eou__  OK . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  OK . I will accept you for a three months-period of probation . Is this satisfactory ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . __eou__
 She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . __eou__  But it's the style now . __eou__
 But it's the style now . __eou__  I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . __eou__
 I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . __eou__  Of course . __eou__
 Of course . __eou__  Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . __eou__
 Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . __eou__  Why is that ? __eou__
 Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . __eou__  Oh , I see . __eou__
 Oh , I see . __eou__  We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . __eou__
 We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . __eou__  What happened to her ? __eou__
 Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve received Scholarship two times . __eou__  Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ? __eou__
 Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accountingthrough self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA . __eou__  Have you ever been a student cadre ? __eou__
 Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class . __eou__  Did it affect you much ? __eou__
 It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . __eou__  In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ? __eou__
 I'm working on my resume . __eou__  Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ? __eou__
 Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet . __eou__  Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? __eou__
 I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good . __eou__  Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . __eou__
 Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . __eou__  Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . __eou__
 I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to a joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the exile market in China . __eou__  How did your previous employers treat you ? __eou__
 They treated me very well . We cooperated harmoniously and respected each other . __eou__  What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? __eou__
 I have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager . __eou__  When you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ? __eou__
 I am sorry to tell you that I have lost the opportunity . __eou__  Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job . __eou__
 Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job . __eou__  Yes , I know I am excellent , but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ’ Ve told me . __eou__
 Yes , I know I am excellent , but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ’ Ve told me . __eou__  What ? Then what did you do ? __eou__
 When I entered the room , I forgot to close the door . Later , I couldn ’ t help smoking , you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ’ s more , I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it . __eou__  You are so careless . You know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . Do remember not to smoke any more , otherwise , you can ’ t find a job . __eou__
 Good luck next time . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Yes , it's still open . __eou__  Terrific ! Then how should I apply for ? __eou__
Miss Wang , how do you do ? I ’ m Allan James , the director of human recourse department of this company . __eou__  How do you do , Mr . James ? Thank you for asking me to come in . __eou__
 How do you do , Mr . James ? Thank you for asking me to come in . __eou__  Not at all . Please sit down , then we can begin . __eou__
 As you know , Miss Wang , we are looking for an executive secretary with business background and good English skills . We looked into your resume and thought you might be a good candidate . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Today ’ s interview is for us to get to know a little about you . And the interview will last a little bit longer . So , if you ’ re comfortable , I want to ask you some questions . __eou__
 ( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei , nice to meet you , sir . __eou__  I am Smith , the personnel director . Please have a seat , son . __eou__
 Yes , I've just married . __eou__  How long have you been married ? __eou__
 I have been married for three years . __eou__  How many people are there in your family ? __eou__
 There are four people in my family . __eou__  Who are the members of your family ? __eou__
 I live in Beijing . __eou__  What's your permanent address ? __eou__
 My permanent address is Apt . 401 , 238 Zhongshan Road , Beijing . __eou__  Where is your birthplace ? __eou__
 My birthplace is Suzhou . __eou__  Where is your domicile ? __eou__
 My domicile is Beijing . __eou__  Give me your telephone number , please . __eou__
I think if I ’ m going to find a job , I ’ ll look over the job board . __eou__  Well , there ’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section . __eou__
 Well , there ’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section . __eou__  Right , so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning . __eou__
 Right , so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning . __eou__  Did you get a copy of the Herald too ? __eou__
 No , why should I ? The Globe ’ s help wanted section is the best . __eou__  That ’ s true , but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn ’ t have . __eou__
 Maybe several weeks , maybe several months . It's hard to tell . __eou__  Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ? __eou__
 Actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there . __eou__  Then , what do you think I should do ? __eou__
I called about that ad we saw in the paper . __eou__  For the bank manager ? __eou__
 That ’ s the one . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 You were right , it was from a headhunter . He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract . __eou__  Well , no surprise there . __eou__
 Well , no surprise there . __eou__  No ! Not at all . But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out . __eou__
 No ! Not at all . But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out . __eou__  Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? __eou__
 I ’ m going there tomorrow . __eou__  Great ! Good luck . __eou__
 Great ! Good luck . __eou__  And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I ’ m downtown , to see what they have . __eou__
 And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I ’ m downtown , to see what they have . __eou__  Good idea . The more people you ask , the better your chances are . __eou__
 No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . __eou__  It better be more than last year . __eou__
 It better be more than last year . __eou__  Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . __eou__

 It faces south with a hillside view . __eou__  The market price for Tong House is around five thousand Hong Kong dollars per square foot , but it also depends on the internal layout and condition of the house . __eou__
 The market price for Tong House is around five thousand Hong Kong dollars per square foot , but it also depends on the internal layout and condition of the house . __eou__  I would like to ask for four point five million Hong Kong dollars . __eou__
 Johnson , and my contact number is 2876543 2 . My office number is 2123456 7 . __eou__  Thank you , Mr . Johnson . May I ask you one more question ? When will your property become available ? __eou__
 In about one month . __eou__  Also , Mr . Johnson , I would like to remind you my company will charge a commission equivalent to one percent of the transaction price in the event of a successful selling of the property through our introduction . __eou__
Good morning Mr Smith . My name is Susan and I am a reporter for the Evening Star . __eou__  Good morning . How can I help you ? __eou__
 About five years . __eou__  And how many staff do you employ ? __eou__
 There is my wife who does the accounts and my brother who helps with the sales . __eou__  So this is a family business . __eou__
 So this is a family business . __eou__  Yes , we are a small family business . __eou__
 Yes , we are a small family business . __eou__  And how many computers do you sell each day ? __eou__

 Hi , I saw the sign outside says that you do all kinds of interior design . __eou__  Yes , we do . Do you have any specific needs ? __eou__
 Yes , I prefer a more contemporary design . __eou__  What kind of color tones do you like ? __eou__
 Blue , green or earth tone colors . I do not like the colors that are too bright . __eou__  I see . And what kind of feeling do you want to create for your kitchen ? __eou__

 But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff . __eou__  Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website . __eou__
 It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read . __eou__  Which websites offer this service ? __eou__
 Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
Hi , Steven . You have finished a wonderful project recently . __eou__  Oh , yeah , A . Thank you for approving my job . __eou__
 Oh , yeah , A . Thank you for approving my job . __eou__  Don't be proud . You'll gain a lot in the following job . __eou__
 Yes , I was . I was almost an hour late . __eou__  What did you say to your boss ? __eou__
 I said I was terribly sorry . But he said it was quite all right . __eou__  Your boss was really nice . __eou__
 Your boss was really nice . __eou__  No , he didn't scold me because he was late , too . __eou__
 Nothing . It's just one of those days . Everyone at the office is sick and I'm getting blamed for work not being done . __eou__  Maybe you need a vacation or something , or maybe a bonus . __eou__
 I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right . __eou__  Why don't you talk to your boss about it ? If you talk to him , he will surely understand . __eou__
 Thanks . See you . __eou__  Don ’ t mention it . See you . __eou__
Good morning . Miss Lee . My name is Alex Jones . I'm the new assistant in the office . __eou__  Welcome and nice to meet you . I heard you were coming today . Is today your first day here in the company ? __eou__
 Yes , I'm looking forward to meeting everybody and getting started on my new job . __eou__  First day is often exciting , isn't it ? Here , let me show you to your desk . You can have this computer and telephone and share the copy machine with us in the office . How do you like it ? __eou__
 Yes , I'm leaving on the 14th of next month . __eou__  Congratulations ! How can you get such a good opportunity to be trained overseas ? __eou__
 Actually , it is a policy in my company . The human resources management department has connections overseas this year , so we can receive training there . __eou__  How nice ! But will you have to pay for the training ? __eou__
 Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . __eou__  Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? __eou__
 Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . __eou__  Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? __eou__
 All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . __eou__  Okay , that's good . I get it . __eou__
 Yes , I can . I have three years experience in operating computers . __eou__  What kind of software can you use ? __eou__
 I can skillfully use Dos , Windows . __eou__  Do you have any certificates on computer ? __eou__
 Yes , I have ACRE certificate , rank 2 . __eou__  Any other certificates ? __eou__
 Yes , I have a Cambridge Business English Certificate and Lawyer ’ s Qualification Certificate . __eou__  Do you have any other special skills ? __eou__
 All right . In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession . __eou__  Have you received any other honors ? __eou__
 Yes . I was chosen as one of ' the Top Ten Prominent Youths of Beijing ' in 2002 . __eou__  Do you have anything published ? __eou__
 Yes . I was president of the Student Council of our university . __eou__  Did you get any honors or awards at your university ? __eou__
 Yes . I was elected Excellent Party Member for four academic years . __eou__  Were you involved in any club activities at your university ? __eou__
 Yes . I was a member of the Student Poetry Society . I like writing poems in my spare time . __eou__  What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ? __eou__
 Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . __eou__  And we should have good sitting posture . __eou__
 I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular . __eou__  Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . __eou__
I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . __eou__  You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . __eou__
 I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . __eou__  You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . __eou__
 Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . __eou__  In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . __eou__
 Yes , I have a driving license . __eou__  Are you willing to drive yourself if the job requires ? __eou__
 Sure . __eou__  One more thing , if you are wanted in this position , you must prepare to travel aboard frequently . __eou__
 I think I can commute that far without any trouble . __eou__  Good . Do you have any particular conditions that you want us to take into consideration ? __eou__
 No , nothing in particular . Thank you . __eou__  Then you'll need to know it's a hard job . You'll often have to work overtime or even on weekends . __eou__
I have a feeling you will get this job . __eou__  Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out . __eou__
 Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out . __eou__  Just remember to be professional and polite . Oh , and don ’ t forget to smile . __eou__
 Yes ... ah ! I forgot to include my e-mail address . __eou__  You ’ d better double-and-triple check it . You don ’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume . Otherwise , you might shoot yourself in the foot . __eou__
 Sort of . I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic . __eou__  I ’ m included on your list of references , right ? My praise of you could really make a difference . __eou__
Hello , Nancy , nice to see you . __eou__  Nice to see you , too . I heard you are a staff of Nokia company . __eou__
 Nice to see you , too . I heard you are a staff of Nokia company . __eou__  Yes , I ’ m satisfied with this job . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ m satisfied with this job . __eou__  Congratulations . What did you do during the interview ? __eou__
 Pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . Good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . Good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable . __eou__  How can I have the good external expressions ? __eou__
 Yes . I am Thou Ping . __eou__  How do you spell you first name ? __eou__
 Ping . P-I-N-G . __eou__  Do you have an English name ? __eou__
 Yes , sir . It is Jane . It was given by my English professor when I was at the university . __eou__  What ’ s your pen name ? __eou__
 My pen name is ' Dark Blue ' . __eou__  How do you like your name ? __eou__
 I like it very much . My name has became part of me . I don ’ t want to change it . __eou__  What ’ s your present ( permanent ) address ? __eou__
 My present address is No . 21 South Zhongshan Road , Apt . 19 , Shanghai . The post code is 220150 . __eou__  You look very young . How old are you ? __eou__
 Actually , I ’ m thirty now . __eou__  Where were you born ? __eou__
 I was born in Xinjiang . __eou__  What is your nationality ? __eou__
 My name is Han Ran , number is 050920 . __eou__  What part of the country do you come from ? __eou__
 I ’ m from Living , Yunnan Province . __eou__  Where is it ? __eou__
 It's a very beautiful place in Southwest China . __eou__  Do you have a big family at your hometown ? __eou__
 Not very big . There are five of us — grandmother , father , mother , sister and I . __eou__  Are you married ? __eou__
 Yes , I think I am quite proficient in both written and spoken English . __eou__  Well , then , please tell me about your English education . __eou__
 I have been studying English since junior high school . And I majored in English in college . __eou__  I see , do you speak any other languages ? __eou__
 My name is Wang Lin . My English name is Linda . __eou__  A nice name , isn't it ? __eou__
 Yeah , like it very much . My name has become a part of me . __eou__  Where do you live ? __eou__

 Yes , I ’ m 38 years old . __eou__  You look very young . __eou__
 You look very young . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__

 Oh , that is wonderful . Congratulations ! __eou__  I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview . __eou__
 I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview . __eou__  Don't mention it . I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality . __eou__
 Don't mention it . I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality . __eou__  Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance . __eou__
 Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance . __eou__  I agree . __eou__

 It's just nine o'clock . __eou__  I'm on time today __eou__
 I'm on time today __eou__  Yes , you're on time . Are you often late ? __eou__
 Yes , quite often . __eou__  You must leave home earlier today . __eou__
 You must leave home earlier today . __eou__  No , I left home at 6:30 as usual . __eou__
 No , I left home at 6:30 as usual . __eou__  Why are you so early today ? __eou__
 Well , as per capital income goes up and up , the growth sector seems to be in the high-end . __eou__  Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined . __eou__
 Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined . __eou__  Yes . Things certainly have changed since I was a boy . We've developed very quickly . __eou__
 Yes . Things certainly have changed since I was a boy . We've developed very quickly . __eou__  Do you think the trend will continue ? __eou__
 I don't see why not . We do have some problems , but we are still willing to work hard and wages aren't too high at this point . __eou__  Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed . __eou__
 In the dining room . It's spacious there . __eou__  We'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting . __eou__
 I've arranged for an interpreter to be present . But it is said these foreigners could speak English . __eou__  Really ? I'll also try to speak slowly . How would you arrange the guests ' seats , Jane ? __eou__
Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair . __eou__  Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? __eou__
 Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . __eou__  Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? __eou__
 That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad . __eou__  We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? __eou__
 Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents . __eou__  4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough . __eou__
 You mean to saya __eou__  It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ? __eou__
 We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment . __eou__  All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately . __eou__
That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal . __eou__  Oh , no , surely . Your ideas were very interesting as well . __eou__
 Oh , no , surely . Your ideas were very interesting as well . __eou__  To show our appreciation for your hard work , we'd like to invite you to have dinner with us . __eou__
So , now we have covered all the important points . __eou__  Yes , I think so . __eou__
 Yes , I think so . __eou__  Before we draft the contract , let's examine the details . __eou__
 Ok , under this contract , we ’ ll supply you with 600 dozen T-shirts , S , M and L equally assorted , at USD 100 per dozen , CFR London . Shipment in July . Payment by irrevocable sight LC . __eou__  Perfect . But what I ’ m concerned about most is the time of delivery 。 __eou__
 Perfect . But what I ’ m concerned about most is the time of delivery 。 __eou__  You may rest assured that shipment will be effected within the time limits stipulated in the contract . But there is also one point I ’ d like to stress . __eou__
 You may rest assured that shipment will be effected within the time limits stipulated in the contract . But there is also one point I ’ d like to stress . __eou__  Yes ? __eou__
 The goods will be inspected by the China Import & Export Commodity Inspection Bureau . It will then issue certificate of quality and a certificate of weight . These will be taken as final and biding . __eou__  Please remember to use both English and Chinese versions and both versions should be equally valid . __eou__
 Then I ’ ll come along three days later to put my signature on it . __eou__  Good . __eou__
 I have a typical nine to five job . Actually , I work a little longer than nine to five most days . __eou__  Do you get paid overtime ? __eou__
 No , I don't . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . __eou__  Do you have any breaks ? __eou__
 We have an hour-long lunch break from twelve to one . We can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn't mind , as long as we get our work done on time . __eou__  My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot of paperwork , doesn't it ? __eou__
 There's some paperwork , but most of the time we put the information into our computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__  Yes , I do . I don't like it very much . __eou__
 Yes , I do . I don't like it very much . __eou__  I work in a cubicle too , but I don't mind it . __eou__
I had a job interview this morning . __eou__  Really ? How did it go ? __eou__
 We want to order 900 dozen . __eou__  The most we can offer you at present is 600 dozen . __eou__
I've just visited your showroom . You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . I like them very much . __eou__  I'm glad you like them . They are all made of silk . Here on display are all the most popular and favorite products . What items are you particularly interested in ? __eou__
 Yes . It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality . You certainly have an eye for good things . __eou__  Thank you for saying that . But what's the unit price ? __eou__
 Here is the catalogue and the price list . You can take a look . __eou__  The price seems acceptable . Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ? __eou__
 There's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great . __eou__  How about lo % ? This price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large . __eou__
 Our price will be not less than $ 5000 . __eou__  Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ? __eou__
 It's $ 120 per yard including a 5 % discount . __eou__  That's much higher than I expected . Can you come down a bit ? __eou__
 The only problem is the price . It's not possible for us to make any sales at this price . __eou__  $ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer . __eou__
 We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one . __eou__  What's the advantage ? Price , I suppose . __eou__
 No , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint . __eou__  What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ? __eou__
 We can make shipment within one month from receipt of order . __eou__  You don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ? __eou__
 We do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . But kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines . __eou__  I see . Well , keep up the good work . See you later . __eou__
If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . __eou__  That's right . Let's go into details of it . __eou__
 If that's the case , there's nothing to be done about it . __eou__  I'm sorry . __eou__
 I'm sorry . __eou__  What's your last word as to the delivery date then ? __eou__
 This is Li with Silk Company . We met last Sunday during the exhibition . __eou__  Oh , yes . I remember your company . __eou__
 Oh , yes . I remember your company . __eou__  Thank you for visiting our products . I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so , could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ? __eou__
 Thank you ! I am interested in your product . But I am not familiar with your corporation . __eou__  In fact , in the past we only attended local exhibitions . __eou__
 In fact , in the past we only attended local exhibitions . __eou__  No wonder . __eou__
 No wonder . __eou__  Here is our brochure . It'll help you get acquainted with our products and company . __eou__
 A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__  Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__
 Very well , Mr Zhang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . __eou__  When will that be ? __eou__
 Yes . It's a prototype of our new product . It has got more advantages than the second did . __eou__  When is the product going to be on the market ? __eou__
 It will be released next month . __eou__  So soon ? It seems to be in the early stages . __eou__
 We have developed new technology about it . And the new product will be a pleasure to be hold . __eou__  Well , it's sounding good ! I'm looking forward to that . __eou__
 Yes . They usually do it . __eou__  Do they charge for that ? __eou__
 Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service . __eou__  Is it the same in America ? __eou__
 They do the work without charge to the importer . __eou__  It's part of their service , isn't it ? __eou__
 Exactly . __eou__  Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ? __eou__
 No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment . __eou__  I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ? __eou__
 You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice . __eou__  I see . Thank you . __eou__
 I see . Thank you . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 I have got a computer engineer's qualification certificate . __eou__  Have you worked in a computer company before ? __eou__
 Oh , yes , I have . I worked part-time as a typewriter in a computer company when I was at college . __eou__  Do you have any ideas on this work ? __eou__
 In my opinion , it has a broad prospect and it needs smart mind . __eou__  Good ! __eou__
 My name is Li Jean . __eou__  You have been in Peking University , hadn't you ? __eou__
 Yes , seven years . __eou__  What degree do you have now ? : __eou__
 Master of Marketing Management . __eou__  Do you have any experience in this field ? __eou__
 Yes . I worked at AB Company . __eou__  Why are you interested in the position ? __eou__
 Because you need a senior production planner who is good at mathematics and fluent in English . I think I am fit for the position . __eou__  All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you 5,000 yuan a month at the start . How do you think about it ? __eou__
 I like to travel and I also like meeting various kinds of people . __eou__  What courses have you completed at college ? __eou__
 I have studied English , tourist culture , guiding methods and techniques and so on . __eou__  Have you learned any other foreign languages ? __eou__
 Yes , I have learned Japanese as well . __eou__  Do you know that is a hard job ? __eou__
 Yes , I know . But I don't mind working hard . __eou__  Is there anything you want to ask about ? __eou__
 Yes , but I will graduate from the Shanghai Finance and Trade school next month . __eou__  Are you sure you can be a successful cashier ? __eou__
 I'm sure . You know my major is statistics and I get excellent records in all of the courses I have taken . __eou__  That's only for your theory foundation . I am afraid if you have ever handled large amounts of cash before ? __eou__
 Yes , my father runs a business so I have opportunity to work in the finance department every holiday . __eou__  Good . I think you'll make a good cashier . __eou__
 Good . I think you'll make a good cashier . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
Hi , I am so glad to see you . __eou__  Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ? __eou__
 You are the leading company in the computer industry . __eou__  Why do you think so ? __eou__
 First , your overwhelming share in the world market . Second , your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees . Third , the diversity in your production line is second to none . __eou__  In what business are you most interested in this organization ? __eou__
 Yes , I have . In fact , I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where I established business ties with several firms . __eou__  What exactly did you do at that company ? __eou__
 Visit customers , dispatch consignments and things like that . __eou__  Did you like your work ? __eou__
 Yes , I did . __eou__  But when and why did you leave the company ? __eou__
 I left it two months ago . I didn't think I could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development . __eou__  I see . Why did you choose our company ? __eou__
 I studied at Anshan University . __eou__  Did you intern anywhere ? __eou__
 Yes , I interned with an accounting firm during tax season . __eou__  That must have been stressful . __eou__
 That must have been stressful . __eou__  Yes , but I learned a lot . __eou__
 Yes , but I learned a lot . __eou__  I'll bet . __eou__
 I'll bet . __eou__  I learned about different tax laws and how they work . __eou__
 Hiring , firing , training , insurances , benefits , retirement plans , salary , vacation . __eou__  They take care of a lot of things . __eou__
 They take care of a lot of things . __eou__  But most of time , they provide assistances . __eou__
 But most of time , they provide assistances . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 Say if the Engineering Department wants to hire a person , they will request HR to find candidates . __eou__  Yes ? __eou__
 The Engineering Manager and his team will interview the candidates . HR will also be involved with the interview , but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits . __eou__  OK . __eou__
 OK . __eou__  Then the Engineering Manager will choose the candidate . __eou__
 Then the Engineering Manager will choose the candidate . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 Here , I'll help you type one up . __eou__  Thanks , Mary . You ’ re a real pal . I'll call now to set up an interview . __eou__
Well , I ’ Ve looked over your resume , Mr . Peepers . __eou__  Please , call me Ted . __eou__
 Salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 I see . __eou__  Salary can be negotiated once we officially offer you the job . __eou__
 Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily . __eou__  But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority . __eou__
 But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority . __eou__  More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . __eou__
 Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ’ t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year . __eou__  How about sick days ? __eou__
 You get five paid sick days . __eou__  Any other benefits ? __eou__
 Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . __eou__  Great . Thanks so much for your time . __eou__
 Great . Thanks so much for your time . __eou__  We ’ ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in . __eou__
 No , I had no interest in the activities in college and I spent most of my spare time reading in the library . __eou__  What kind of activity would make you get involved ? __eou__
 Yes , I have obtained an accountant's qualification and a driver's license . __eou__  How long did it take you to get your driver's license ? __eou__
That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company . __eou__  Yes , I have an overall understanding . __eou__
 Yes , I have an overall understanding . __eou__  When we have the final results , we will call you . __eou__
 If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . __eou__  But if I don't pass , will you call me ? __eou__
 I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful . __eou__  Then do I have the chance to get this job ? __eou__
 I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation . __eou__  Your mentality is very good and that's great . __eou__
 Your mentality is very good and that's great . __eou__  Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview . __eou__
 Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__

 I'll do my utmost if I am hired . __eou__  Do you have any short-term goals ? __eou__
 Yes , I am . That's why I make plans before I do anything . __eou__  How do you plan to do your present job ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager . __eou__  Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office . __eou__
 Yes , it is . __eou__  I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . __eou__
Decent dressing and appearance , which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer , are surely quite important . __eou__  Of course . Generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience . __eou__
 Of course . Generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience . __eou__  Whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality __eou__
 Whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality __eou__  Professional suits may be the best choice . __eou__
 Professional suits may be the best choice . __eou__  Gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome . __eou__
 Gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome . __eou__  Ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up . __eou__
 Ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up . __eou__  But those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided . __eou__
 But those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided . __eou__  Name brand is not necessary . Anything decent will be fine . __eou__
 Name brand is not necessary . Anything decent will be fine . __eou__  You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview . __eou__
 You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview . __eou__  Only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed . __eou__
 Only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed . __eou__  In a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all . __eou__
 In a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all . __eou__  In other words , too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials . __eou__
 Most willingly . It's 600 dollars per ton . __eou__  That's a high price . __eou__
 That's a high price . __eou__  But you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year . __eou__
 But you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year . __eou__  I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial . __eou__
 Yes , I wrote a thesis entitled English Education in High School and it was published in the Education Magazine . __eou__  Have you received any honors ? __eou__
Brandy , I am supposed to participate in an interview tomorrow . __eou__  That's great . You need to prepare for it . __eou__
 I am afraid I would tense up during the interview . __eou__  It doesn't matter . Just do your best to sell yourself . __eou__
DM210 is equivalent to 400 RIB . __eou__  Don't you wish to employ RIB of ours ? US Dollars might be adopted . __eou__
 Well , I can't speak for all universities , but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans . I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation . __eou__  Yeah , that's what I thought . But , I've heard that the perks are better . I was wondering if that was really true . __eou__
 I'd have to say yes and no on that . I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to . I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that . __eou__  Oh , that's great . It sounds like you're really happy with your move . __eou__
 Oh , that's great . It sounds like you're really happy with your move . __eou__  Yeah , I guess I am . Working at a university is really suits me . __eou__
 I am a size 6 . __eou__  Try this on please . __eou__
I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 It looks like the shipping company did this . __eou__  We'd better take it up with them , in that case . __eou__
We're sorry , but we cannot allow your claim . __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 The material was not damaged by us . __eou__  We'll have to talk this over some more . __eou__
 The order was in good shape when it left out factory . __eou__  It certainly didn't arrive here that way . __eou__
 It certainly didn't arrive here that way . __eou__  We'll make it right with you , of course . __eou__
 You'll have 10 days paid vacation every year . __eou__  What about the insurance and housing policies ? __eou__
 We will provide you with life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . __eou__  How often is the bonus ? __eou__
 You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . __eou__  Do I have training opportunities ? __eou__
 We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . __eou__  Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think for a couple of days before I give you my final answer . __eou__
 Ok , thank you for your time and patience . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 I wish to have a job in which I can make good use of my strengths and have further improvement . And your company meets all my requirements . __eou__  Have you got a clear idea about our company ? __eou__
 Yes , I have purposefully done some homework in advance . __eou__  Have you tried other companies ? __eou__
 Actually , I have applied to several companies recently . But I am most satisfied with your company . __eou__  Will you take a job which is not in line with your major ? __eou__
 Admittedly , I hope it is a job in line with my specialty . But I will make the best effort to do the job whatever is assigned to me . __eou__  How long would you work here if you were admitted ? __eou__
 I would continue to work in the company as long as the job suits me well . __eou__  Do you expect a high salary ? __eou__
Mary , this company is pretty good . I really want to have an interview . __eou__  Have you made an appointment with this company ? __eou__
 Yes , it's very important to make an appointment before the interview . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 If you go to the company without appointment , the interviewers may happen to be busy with other things , and have no time to give you an interview . __eou__  Yes , you are right . __eou__
 Yes , you are right . __eou__  If the interviewers are not in the company , you will go there for nothing . __eou__
 If the interviewers are not in the company , you will go there for nothing . __eou__  Sure . Why didn't I think of that ? __eou__
 Sure . Why didn't I think of that ? __eou__  So you should make an appointment in advance with the company for the interview . __eou__
 We can inform the department in charge and ask for revocation of passport . __eou__  What else do you need to keep him in temporary custody ? __eou__
 Yes , speaking . __eou__  I want to know whether you will come to the interview . So have you accepted offers from other companies ? __eou__

 I only typed several copies of my resume . __eou__  That's not enough . You have many other things to prepare . __eou__
 No , I haven't had a chance to take the exam as I have just arrived here . __eou__  Could you tell me about your professional education ? __eou__
 A few of the graphic designers are a bit behind in their work because of computer problems . __eou__  How have they decided to deal with that ? __eou__
 They've agreed to work over-time until it's finished . They've even decided to come in on the weekend . __eou__  That's true dedication . I'm impressed . When is it due ? __eou__
 We agreed that the deadline was next Friday . __eou__  Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway . __eou__
 I know you have a tight schedule , so I won't take up more of your time . Have a good evening . __eou__  You , too ! See you tomorrow . __eou__
 They are responsibility , skill , patience , quietness , and so on . __eou__  What kind of medicines does the doctor usually prescribe to children who get high fever ? __eou__

 Yes , I have found three companies . __eou__  Have you called to inquire about the positions ? __eou__
 Yes , but the results are not so satisfying . __eou__  What's the matter ? __eou__
 I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone . __eou__  What a pity ! __eou__
 What a pity ! __eou__  The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago , and had been overdue . __eou__

 I've had a delightful time and I really appreciate your spending so much time showing me the sights . __eou__  It was fun for me , too.It gave me a chance to get away from my routine and do something a little different . __eou__
 It was fun for me , too.It gave me a chance to get away from my routine and do something a little different . __eou__  You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? __eou__
 No one . __eou__  Oh , then I will arrange one of my staff to meet you at the airport . __eou__
 Well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . __eou__  I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! __eou__
 I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! __eou__  I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! __eou__

 I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . __eou__  I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . __eou__
Welcome , Mr . Sun . __eou__  Thank you for your entertaining me . __eou__
 Thank you for your entertaining me . __eou__  Today I'll invite you to enjoy the seafood.Please make yourself at home . __eou__
 I am running Chinese arts and crafts . __eou__  What arts and crafts are you interested in this time ? __eou__
 And this is the schedule for Mrs . Watson . Eileen from our department will take care of her . __eou__  Ok . Shall we discuss the schedule in the lobby ? __eou__
 I don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__  It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . __eou__
 To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__  Why ? What happened ? __eou__
 Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__  That's not very fair . What did you do ? __eou__
 There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . __eou__  Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__
 He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__  Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__
 I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__  Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ? __eou__
 Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . __eou__  That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders . __eou__

 Sure . __eou__  I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do is to get on the train tonight at 7 pm . __eou__
 Oh , no . We've bought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable . __eou__  Will the train be very crowded ? __eou__
 They've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9 __eou__  Where will I be staying ? __eou__
 She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . __eou__  What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__
 When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__  You're right . If she walked into meeting with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__
 It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__  I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__
 I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__  On top of that , she didn't seem to have any sense of people's personal space.She didn't keep enough distance between us during the meeting . __eou__
 On top of that , she didn't seem to have any sense of people's personal space.She didn't keep enough distance between us during the meeting . __eou__  That's true . I guess we ’ ll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__
 I'm not sure , but let me check my schedule ... Ah , no . I have nothing then . __eou__  Great ! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 . Here's an invitation card for you . __eou__
 Yes . Nice to meet you , Mrs Smith . __eou__  Nice to meet you too , Mr . Zhang . __eou__

 Well , frankly speaking , I am running a little behind . It's 40 % done . __eou__  Do you have any problem during the process ? You should speed things up . __eou__
 I have little chance to communicate with colleagues when I have problems . They are always too busy to help a green hand like me . __eou__  Have you ever helped others when they are in trouble ? Most will give a hand to someone who has helped him . __eou__
 I did . But I am so depressed because there is nobody that will help me . __eou__  And you should have good co-operation with other colleagues , you know a scientific schedule brings efficiency to the work . __eou__
 Don't you know that ? It's all about new office rules . __eou__  What does it say ? __eou__
 It says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . It might be the most terrible thing for you . __eou__  I can smoke outside of the office . But what else does it say ? __eou__
 If you want to ask for leave , you should get the approval from the manager in charge of your department . __eou__  But if there is an emergency and the manager is of absence , what should we do ? __eou__
 The note says you should call your manager first , and then tell him your reason , and then ask him for the approval . __eou__  OK , OK , got it . By the way , what about the vacation policy ? Anything changed ? __eou__
 No . We still enjoy 10 - day of paid vacation per year . __eou__  Can we have 7 - day holiday on National Day ? __eou__
 Of course . That's what we deserve . __eou__  That's great ! __eou__
 That's great ! __eou__  I have something else to remind you of . Don't be late , if you are late , you will be fined 20 Yuan per minute . __eou__
 Are you kidding ? I always get up late . Oh , my God . Can't believe that . That is terrible . __eou__  So remember to set your alarm clock . __eou__
 It's an e-mail . It says , We need to meet . I'll give you a sweet treat . It's not what you think . __eou__  Uh-oh . He's heating up . What are you going to do now ? __eou__

 I know you , Zina . You're only nice when you want something . __eou__  If we want to beat WebTracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand . __eou__
 I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship . __eou__  What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ? __eou__
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable . __eou__  Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__  I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__
 I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__  Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss . __eou__
 Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__  Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper ! __eou__
 Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper ! __eou__  Oh , so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself . __eou__
 But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless . __eou__  Oh , no one is perfect . __eou__
 Oh , no one is perfect . __eou__  That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way . __eou__
 We have the equal partnership in team . __eou__  Thanks very much and you're very eloquent . __eou__

 Not yet . To tell you the truth , I don't know how to write it . I've considered it for several days . __eou__  What ? Man , you don't know how to write a project report ? That's sounds a little bit ridiculous . __eou__
 Don't laugh at me , please . I'm serious . I've never been required to write this kind of report before , I only do the research reports . __eou__  Oh , sorry , I've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic . __eou__
 Oh , sorry , I've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic . __eou__  So what items must be involved in this report ? __eou__
 That's too complicated . __eou__  And only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report . __eou__
 Oh , my God , is there any fixed for mat for it-the one that I just need to fix my information in ? __eou__  I'm sorry . There isn't . Because different people have to write different kinds of reports . __eou__
 I'm sorry . There isn't . Because different people have to write different kinds of reports . __eou__  But I don't know how to work the Microsoft Words . Could you please give me a hand ? __eou__

 Well , she asked me if my parents wanted me to be a steward . __eou__  Did she tell you whether you would get the job ? __eou__

 It was a good company to work for , I enjoyed my time with them . __eou__  You like that work ? __eou__
 Yes , I like it very much , the work was not very demanding , and the people I work with were friendly . __eou__  Why do you want to leave the company ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
Good morning ! __eou__  Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ? __eou__
 I really can't say how long she'll be . __eou__  Can I leave a message , please ? __eou__
 Yes , I can . __eou__  How many words a minute ? __eou__
 About 100 words a minute . __eou__  En ... and can you speak any foreign languages ? __eou__

 No , I can ’ t speak French . But I can speak Italian , not very well though . __eou__  ... Can you start next week ? __eou__
 Yes , on Monday . __eou__  You mean I have the job ? __eou__
 You mean I have the job ? __eou__  Yes , that ’ s right , you have the job now . __eou__
 I will if you tell me how you're so sure that we're going to come out on top . __eou__  We just will.Trust me on that . __eou__
 We just will.Trust me on that . __eou__  After what you did , I don't know how hard Elvin's going to work to meet your deadline . __eou__
 After what you did , I don't know how hard Elvin's going to work to meet your deadline . __eou__  He'll do it . He's too proud not to . __eou__
 He'll do it . He's too proud not to . __eou__  You've got everyone figured out , don't you ? __eou__
 No , but I can write very fast . __eou__  Can you use the computer or other office machines ? __eou__

 Yes , I see , this is a permanent position . __eou__  Can you work every day from 9 to 5 ? __eou__
 Oh , no , I ’ m student at a university , and I have to study most of the time . I can only work part time . __eou__  I couldn ’ t possibly hire you . You can ’ t take shorthand , you can ’ t use a computer , and you can only work part time . __eou__
Hi , Zina . I had a feeling you'd be stopping by . __eou__  Then you've heard from Vital ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Look , Vince . I didn't mean to step on your toes , but we need to be decisive . __eou__
 This is awkward , I know . I know you're upset . But in two weeks you'll be thanking me . __eou__  Maybe . Maybe I will . __eou__
I don't make idle threats . __eou__  I guess not . __eou__
 I guess not . __eou__  I hope you're not turning into a sissy on me , Dave . __eou__
 Look , I want to succeed just as much as you do . Well , maybe not quite that much . __eou__  If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail . __eou__
 Of course . __eou__  How can you be so sure ? Do you know something I don't ? __eou__
 I have a plan for handling WebTracker . Step one is the Stars.com contract . __eou__  What's step two ? __eou__
 Let me explain . To get more cash , I'll have to borrow more from Vital , the venture capitalists . __eou__  I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to . __eou__
 I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to . __eou__  Exactly . Instead of increasing their position , I want to increase yours . __eou__
 Wilson . __eou__  And your other names ? __eou__
 Steven Michael . __eou__  Have you got your e-mail address ? __eou__
 Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com . __eou__  How old are you ? __eou__
 Twenty-one . __eou__  Where were you Bron ? __eou__
 Only as a clerk in a store . __eou__  I see . Well , consulting is a little different . __eou__
 I see . Well , consulting is a little different . __eou__  I'm a quick leamer , Mr.Jenkins . __eou__
 I'm a quick leamer , Mr.Jenkins . __eou__  Umm hmm.Do you have a diver's license ? __eou__
 Yes , and I'm a very good driver . __eou__  Fine.We provide a company car for our consultants . __eou__
 Fine.We provide a company car for our consultants . __eou__  Do I have to travel a lot ? __eou__
 Oh yes-five days a week.You have to visit customers all over the territory . __eou__  But how will I get to know the products ? __eou__
 Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course . __eou__  How much commission do your consultants get ? __eou__
 Five percent . __eou__  Well , I'm very interested in the job . __eou__
 Well , I'm very interested in the job . __eou__  Fine.The next course starts a week from tomorrow . __eou__
 Sure . I don ’ t mind . __eou__  And can I come in late tomorrow ? __eou__
 I don ’ t see why not . __eou__  And may I take Friday off ? __eou__
 Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ’ clock . __eou__  What ’ s your name , please ? __eou__
Good morning . __eou__  Er , good morning , yes , er ... __eou__
 Er , good morning , yes , er ... __eou__  I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night . __eou__
 Oh , Candida Fawcett . __eou__  Oh , yes.Erm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ? __eou__
 Well , I just thought that it was right up my street you know . __eou__  Really , hmmmm.Erm , well , could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself ? __eou__
 Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ... __eou__  Where exactly have you been working , please ? __eou__
 Well , keep this under your hat , but I think I'm going to quit after New Year . __eou__  Quit this company ? Oh ... wow . __eou__
 I know I should be pretty happy here , but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need . I'm a good graphic designer ... __eou__  One of the best in the company . __eou__
 One of the best in the company . __eou__  That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . __eou__
 That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . __eou__  Oh , I get it . Simply put , you're bored , huh ? __eou__
 Well , I know Brown's Biscuit Factory are looking for a porter.They pay $ 200 a week . __eou__  That sounds all right . __eou__
 That sounds all right . __eou__  Good.Now here's the address of the factory.The manager's name is ... __eou__
 Well , Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and ... well ... um ... __eou__  I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job . __eou__
 I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job . __eou__  Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ? __eou__
 As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming . __eou__  Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . __eou__
 Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . __eou__  I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . __eou__
 I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . __eou__  Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . __eou__
 Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . __eou__  Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . __eou__
 When I was in LA , I met the WebTracker sales rep . __eou__  He couldn't have told you . Only a few people at WebTracker know about me . __eou__
 He couldn't have told you . Only a few people at WebTracker know about me . __eou__  The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . He said everybody at WebTracker used them . __eou__
 The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . He said everybody at WebTracker used them . __eou__  I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . __eou__
 I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . __eou__  We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest . __eou__
 Yeah . Let me see if he'll do it , and I'll get back to you . __eou__  OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin . __eou__
 Guess again , Dave . I have no intention of leaving invoking . Never did . __eou__  What do you mean ? You didn't ? Oh , no ... No ! __eou__
 That's right , Dave . I tricked you into giving a confession . And I've recorded every word of it . __eou__  But how ? So you knew all along I was with WebTracker ? How did you know ? __eou__
 It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor . __eou__  You wouldn't do that . Would you ? __eou__
I think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music . __eou__  You do ? How are you going to contact him ? __eou__
 I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen . __eou__  What does it say ? Do you think he'll see it ? __eou__
 He'll see it . It says , I like sweets . Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot . __eou__  Can I spy on you guys from the window ? __eou__
Hi , Dave . You're early . __eou__  So you knew it was me ? __eou__
 I had an idea . __eou__  Look , before we get into the secret admirer thing , I want to talk to you about WebTracker . __eou__
My accounts go where I go . Vince knows that . __eou__  Wow . You are a real snake . __eou__
 Wow . You are a real snake . __eou__  It's business , Dave . __eou__
 It's business , Dave . __eou__  I know , I know . Kill , or die , right ? __eou__
 Right . The faint of heart should not apply . __eou__  I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself . __eou__
 I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself . __eou__  So do I . __eou__
 Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com . __eou__  I've got it under control . __eou__
 I've got it under control . __eou__  You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? __eou__
 Or they'll take over the market before we even get started . __eou__  Right . And that would be a total giga-bummer . __eou__
 Right . And that would be a total giga-bummer . __eou__  I guess we'd better get back to work . __eou__
 Well , Vince dropped off some sales reports for you.Said you signed a big deal with HomeSupplies.com . __eou__  They're small fry . Tonight I'm going to LA to negotiate with Stars.com . That'll be big . __eou__
 They're small fry . Tonight I'm going to LA to negotiate with Stars.com . That'll be big . __eou__  You're right . All the entertainment web sites follow Stars.com . __eou__
 You're right . All the entertainment web sites follow Stars.com . __eou__  Who else has been here ? __eou__
 Elvin stopped by to see me . __eou__  Elvin ? Which one is he ? __eou__
I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ... __eou__  and what if it doesn't work out , right ? __eou__
 Exactly . __eou__  You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ? __eou__
 Because I won't let it fail . __eou__  But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ? __eou__
 Yes . If we get it , we'll really be set for success . __eou__  And to get it , we have to beat WebTracker to the punch . __eou__
 And to get it , we have to beat WebTracker to the punch . __eou__  OK , I'm with you so far . __eou__
 OK , I'm with you so far . __eou__  That's why I promised that invoking would be up and running by the end of next week . __eou__
 yes , I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow . __eou__  How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . __eou__
 How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . __eou__  That's all right . I'm almost finished.Do you need my help ? __eou__
 Excuse me for taking your time . __eou__  It's nothing Navy . __eou__
 Mike , you're late again . __eou__  I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I __eou__
 I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I __eou__  Do you think I believe the story like that ? __eou__
 But it's true . __eou__  How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? __eou__
 That's coincidence 。 __eou__  Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。 __eou__
Jack ! You've really done it this time . __eou__  What ? What happened ? __eou__
Good morning ! __eou__  Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ? __eou__
 I really can't say how long she'll be . __eou__  Can I leave a message , please ? __eou__
 I'll try . __eou__  Thank you very much , Mr.James . __eou__
 Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently.And you don't work well with other employees . __eou__  Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . __eou__
 It's unfair . __eou__  We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . __eou__
Hello . Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ? __eou__  I'm Mr.Stephen ' s secretary . He has an appointment with Mr.Green today . __eou__

 An impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company . __eou__  There are people everywhere.What ' s that girl doing ? __eou__
 She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network . __eou__  And what about that man there ? __eou__
 He is our accountant . __eou__  I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employers . __eou__
 I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employers . __eou__  Indeed , they are . Keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company . __eou__
 In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now . __eou__  Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ?

 Yes . __eou__  I got the message . I'm quiting . __eou__

 I want a job in which I can use English , I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work . __eou__  I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs . __eou__
 Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing . __eou__  Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing . __eou__

Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . __eou__  Really ? Where did you hear that ? __eou__
 I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__  No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__
 No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__  That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__
 Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__  Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__

Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support . __eou__
 No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support . __eou__  Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place . __eou__
 I'm from Germany . __eou__  So you speak German , don't you ? __eou__
 Yeah , but I can speak English , too . __eou__  Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? __eou__
 A little French . __eou__  Good . __eou__
 Well , actually I want to tell you that I've put in notice . __eou__  Really ? Why ? __eou__
 Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go . __eou__  But they wouldn't lay you off ! You are the most experienced project manager in the company . __eou__
 But they wouldn't lay you off ! You are the most experienced project manager in the company . __eou__  Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company . __eou__
 Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company . __eou__  Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ? __eou__
 Senior director of market research . In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown .

I bet that made the decision to leave a lot easier . __eou__
 Sounds a great opportunity . I bet that made the decision to leave a lot easier . __eou__  Indeed . But let's stay in touch . I'll let you know how things go . __eou__
Good morning , Mr . Smith . __eou__  Good morning , Jamie . What time is it now ? __eou__
 It is 9 o'clock now . __eou__  I see . What is today's schedule ? __eou__
 You have two meetings today . One is at 10 am , and the other is at 2 pm . After the meeting , you will have dinner with Mr . Brown at the Chinese restaurant in Sister Hotel . __eou__  OK . Can you prepare things for the meeting in the meeting room ? Make enough copies of the handouts . __eou__
 No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . __eou__  What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__
 Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . __eou__  You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . __eou__
 You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . __eou__  I know . But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . __eou__
 Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university . __eou__  That sounds fine .

 Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 He spoke evil behind his back . __eou__  How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? __eou__
 Someone told joe off . __eou__  He is then in a very difficult situation . __eou__
 He is then in a very difficult situation . __eou__  Sure . He ’ ll get the bag . I think . __eou__
 Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations . __eou__  If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ? __eou__
 No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work . __eou__  Working here involves a busy schedule and overtime.Is that true ? __eou__
 Yes.That ' s true . We are always busy . The company attaches great importance to high efficiency . Sometimes we have to work overtime , but not always . And we have extra pay for extra work . __eou__  It seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as I expected . Thank you for your help . __eou__
 I am , sir . __eou__  Your duty is to keep a check on those prisoners from now on . __eou__
We have successfully fulfilled our work plan . In fact , we are No . 1 in terms of market share . __eou__  You have gotten amazing success . Congratulations ! __eou__
 You have gotten amazing success . Congratulations ! __eou__  I hope we can continue to get support from the departments concerned . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications . __eou__  Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ? __eou__
 Two . French and Spanish . __eou__  And how well can you speak them ? __eou__
 Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . __eou__  And how about your Spanish ? __eou__
 Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . __eou__  I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . __eou__
 I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . __eou__  In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . __eou__
 I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company # for approximately 10 years . __eou__  Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills . __eou__
 I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating systems . __eou__  Where do you see yourself five years from now ? __eou__
 If the goods are to be transshipped from one means of transportation to another during the course of the entire voyage , it's called ' combined transportation ' . __eou__  Why is it necessary ? __eou__
 We are always willing to choose the big ports as the loading ports . __eou__  What's your unloading port , please ? __eou__
 This weekend . __eou__  Please pay close attention to the safety of the shipment . __eou__
 About 3 weeks . __eou__  When will you be able to deliver ? __eou__
 Let me check.Well , in October . __eou__  Is there any possibility for you to ensure prompt shipment ? __eou__
 First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__  That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . __eou__
 Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . __eou__  Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? __eou__
 Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . __eou__  When will the branch office open ? __eou__
 Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . __eou__  Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? __eou__
 Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazine . __eou__  I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers . __eou__
 Well , I just want to enjoy what I ’ m doing it ’ s the most important thing to me . __eou__  Just this ? __eou__
 Yes , because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher . Or have more opportunities to have career growth . __eou__  Do you want to get a promotion ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . __eou__  Where would you like to be in 5 years ? __eou__
 In five years , I ’ d like to be a senior manager of this corporation . __eou__  How do you plan to accomplish this ? __eou__
 In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now . __eou__  Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ? __eou__
 I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time . __eou__  Why do you think you be a good fit or this job ? __eou__
 Because I ’ m very competent in this area . __eou__  Can you working under pressure ? __eou__
 Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines . __eou__  Are you more a follower or a leader ? __eou__
Billy , you are late again . __eou__  I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? __eou__
 Yes he ' s in his office . __eou__  Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . __eou__
 Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . __eou__  Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . __eou__
 Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . __eou__  You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? __eou__
A :: You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you . __eou__  B :: Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson . __eou__
 B :: Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson . __eou__  A :: Tim , please . Please be seated . __eou__
 Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! __eou__  OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it . __eou__
 OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it . __eou__  The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments ! __eou__
 Not bad . But there is more room for improvement . __eou__  I jumped the gun . __eou__
 I jumped the gun . __eou__  There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow . __eou__
 With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired . __eou__  I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime . __eou__
 I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime . __eou__  Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . __eou__  And how do you like working for IBM ? __eou__
 It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot . __eou__  What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ? __eou__
 I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others . __eou__  That ’ s good . We always need team players here . __eou__
You look very professional in the suit . __eou__  The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable . __eou__
 The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable . __eou__  I appreciate it . It is related to company image . __eou__
I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . __eou__  Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . __eou__
 Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . __eou__  You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? __eou__
 To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . __eou__  But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . __eou__
 It ’ s hard to commute a long way . __eou__  Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . __eou__
 I have done something like that before . __eou__  Are you still interested in it ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . __eou__  This time you can bring your daughter with you . __eou__
 Actually , I received that kind of training when I was in college . __eou__  How about your experience ? __eou__
 So you're quite confident in your experience and skill __eou__  I think so . __eou__
 Yes , I need a job that can give full play to my skills . __eou__  Do you like a job in a library , working with books ? __eou__
One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for . __eou__  Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? __eou__
 He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . __eou__  Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? __eou__
 Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . __eou__  I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . __eou__
Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . __eou__  Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__
 Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__  I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__
 Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . __eou__  How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? __eou__
Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . __eou__  I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . __eou__
 I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . __eou__  This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . __eou__
You have been doing a great job this year and I am very satisfied with your work . __eou__  I am very happy to know my work could be recognized by you and our company . __eou__
 I am very happy to know my work could be recognized by you and our company . __eou__  Based on your contribution , I would like to give you a pay raise . Your monthly salary will be increased by 800 Yuan . This increase includes an 80 % married increase based on your achievements and increase responsibilities and then the additional 20 % increase were reflecting the changes in cost of living . __eou__
 Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__  Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__
 Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__  That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . __eou__

For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people .

 You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . __eou__  Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . __eou__
 I would like to go but I have to finish a very important presentation . Our boss needs it for tomorrow ’ s morning meeting and I was given the complete information only late this afternoon . __eou__  Sounds like our boss . Typically him always late with important information . Anything I can help ? __eou__
 I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting . __eou__  Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ? __eou__
 It is ok . My boss briefs me later on . __eou__  Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ? __eou__
 Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! __eou__  Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . __eou__
 Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . __eou__  Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? __eou__
 Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . __eou__  Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__
 Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__  I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . __eou__
Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . __eou__  Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . __eou__
 Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . __eou__  Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . __eou__
 Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . __eou__  Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . __eou__
 Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . __eou__  I will do my best . __eou__
 Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . __eou__  Well , that is also very efficient , right ? __eou__
 Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . __eou__  That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . __eou__
 Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__  Who will be there ? __eou__
 James is going to be packed off there . __eou__  That is good . He can leave you alone this time . __eou__
The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , I feel really down . __eou__  What ’ s up ? __eou__
 Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday . __eou__  Anything that distracts you from work ? __eou__
 Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . __eou__  Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ? __eou__
 If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . __eou__  Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . __eou__
 Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . __eou__  Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . __eou__
 Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . __eou__  Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way . __eou__
Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . __eou__  If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . __eou__
 If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . __eou__  Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . __eou__

By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . __eou__  But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . __eou__
 But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . __eou__  I doubt that . __eou__
 We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__  What do you think his strengths are ? __eou__
I am thinking about resigning from my current job . __eou__  Have you thought about it seriously ? __eou__
 Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . __eou__  Ok , did you find a new company ? __eou__
 Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . __eou__  Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . __eou__
 Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . __eou__  Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues . __eou__
 I think meeting people . There are people from all over the country , all over the world , all walks of life which is the most interesting part of my job . __eou__  What do you find annoying ? __eou__
You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year . __eou__  Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed . __eou__
 Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed . __eou__  Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one . __eou__
 If we were in the same conference room , I would not work late these days . That conference room has been booked out . This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu . __eou__  Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . I am sure that your hard work will pay off . __eou__
You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__  Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . __eou__
 Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . __eou__  I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . __eou__
I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . __eou__  That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__

That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__  It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? __eou__
 That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . __eou__  Certainly . __eou__
Here is the document you asked for this morning . __eou__  Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . __eou__
 Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__
 You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__  This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? __eou__
 The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__  Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . __eou__
Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . __eou__  Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . __eou__
 Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . __eou__  You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__
 Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__  Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__
 Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__  Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . __eou__
 What for ? Oh , I see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market . __eou__  Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . __eou__
 Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . __eou__  Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . __eou__
I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price . __eou__  I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . __eou__
 I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . __eou__  I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . __eou__
 Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . __eou__  I ’ ll do my best . __eou__
 I ’ ll do my best . __eou__  That ’ s the way to go . __eou__
I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . __eou__  It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . __eou__
 It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . __eou__  I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . __eou__
 I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . __eou__  Then keep up the good work . __eou__
We did a survey on your job performance . __eou__  How did I do ? __eou__
 Not so good . Lots of complains . __eou__  Really ? I thought I was doing well . __eou__
 Really ? I thought I was doing well . __eou__  Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . __eou__
I'm really in a flap about the interview . __eou__  Take it easy.you ' Ve made enough preparations . __eou__
 Take it easy.you ' Ve made enough preparations . __eou__  I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes . __eou__
 I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes . __eou__  I'm sure you'll pass it . __eou__
 Hi , I was just coming to see you.But since you made the trek to my office , you get to go first . __eou__  Okay , I'm putting together a report on the Allied Marketing Co . failure , and I seem to have run into a stone wall . Can you help me out ? __eou__
 Name it . __eou__  I'm supposed to have this package ready for mailing out tomorrow morning and I'm miles away from being ready.Can you edit this product study I wrote while I do these ? __eou__
 That works for me . __eou__  Give me the study . I'll start as soon as I get back to my office . __eou__
 I guess you're right.But like you said , you called me here to check me out . I've been doing the same . __eou__  Ha , ha , ha ! That's fair.How did I do ? __eou__
 Quite good , actually . I'm pretty sure you're demanding , but fair and honest . I feel we can work together . __eou__  Good , well , here's what I need from you . Are you ready ? __eou__
 Shoot ! __eou__  Well , I know you work for someone else , but as your client , please , we have to get this straight between us . I'm your client , not your company.As your client , I expect you to be square with me at all times . Can you do that ? __eou__
Both of the two young ladies are the candidates for the position __eou__  The question is we only need one . __eou__
 The question is we only need one . __eou__  Right.The choice is yours , the tall one or the short one ? __eou__
 Right , this is not a drill . This is for all the marbles . __eou__  When do you need it ? __eou__
 ASAP , in writing of course . __eou__  Sure , who am I bidding against ? __eou__
 That's right . My appointment is for 11 o'clock . __eou__  Mr wilson is on the line right now . Please have a seat . He'll be right with you . __eou__
 I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company . __eou__  Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ? __eou__
 Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that . __eou__  Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ? __eou__
I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . __eou__  Sorry to hear that . __eou__
 Sorry to hear that . __eou__  How about next week ? __eou__
 What a pity ! __eou__  If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? __eou__
I was really glad to hear about your award , congratulations ! __eou__  Thanks . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there . __eou__
 Thanks . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there . __eou__  You ’ Ve been working there for so long with so much sacrifice . You definitely deserve it . __eou__
 You ’ Ve been working there for so long with so much sacrifice . You definitely deserve it . __eou__  Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work . __eou__
I'm sorry , I'm engaged at 2 p . m . __eou__  If you don't mind , let's make it a little later.What about three or four ? __eou__
 Oh , my computer crashed again ! __eou__  Can I help ? __eou__
 Oh , I'm sorry , Nigel . I'm rushing to a meet right now . __eou__  Sure , no problem . Can we fix a time to talk later ? __eou__
 I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . __eou__  Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . __eou__
 This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries . __eou__  And what is it regarding please ? __eou__
 We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr.Chen will know why I'm calling . __eou__  Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter . __eou__
 It's 2781703 1 . __eou__  2781703 1 . Sure . I'll make sure he gets the message . __eou__
 I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation . __eou__  Since when did Eddy start doing ballet ? ! __eou__
 Not very long from the looks of it ! __eou__  Look ! He has a partner ! __eou__
 He's dancing with Jack ! __eou__  Gross ! __eou__
 Gross ! __eou__  The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss . __eou__
 The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss . __eou__  But I think Eddy is going too far ! __eou__
 But I think Eddy is going too far ! __eou__  You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ... __eou__
 You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ... __eou__  Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt ! __eou__
 Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt ! __eou__  How embarrassing ! __eou__
Oh . It looks like Jack is going to make his annual speech . __eou__  Couldn't he wait until we're finished eating ? __eou__
 Couldn't he wait until we're finished eating ? __eou__  Yeah . I'm still hungry , but I guess it's kind of rude to keep eating while he's talking , huh ? __eou__
 Yeah . I'm still hungry , but I guess it's kind of rude to keep eating while he's talking , huh ? __eou__  Can you even hear what he's saying ? __eou__
 Yeah , that sounds right . __eou__  There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ? __eou__
 Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that . __eou__  Eric Chang in accounting ? __eou__
 That's him ! __eou__  I'll call him and tell him you're here . __eou__
 Here's my card . __eou__  OK . I'll have him come up to get you . __eou__
 Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? __eou__  It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? __eou__
 The accounts department , I think . __eou__  The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . __eou__
Look ! They're going to do the first drawing ! It's for a DVD player ! __eou__  Hmm . That must be the DVD player that another one of my friends donated . He owns one of the largest electronics stores in Taipei ! __eou__
 Hmm . That must be the DVD player that another one of my friends donated . He owns one of the largest electronics stores in Taipei ! __eou__  They're picking a name ... It's ... Darryl from marketing ! Rats ! __eou__
 They're picking a name ... It's ... Darryl from marketing ! Rats ! __eou__  Don't worry ! There are a lot more prizes ! I know , because the prizes are all from companies that I work with ! __eou__
 Don't worry ! There are a lot more prizes ! I know , because the prizes are all from companies that I work with ! __eou__  Hmm ... Darryl doesn't look like the red underwear type ... __eou__
Our supervisor Lester does . Actually , Lester is kind of like the kitchen god . __eou__  The kitchen god ? What does he do ? __eou__
 He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! __eou__  Oh , no ! I did a lot of bad things this year . I hope the kitchen god isn't like Lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody ! __eou__
 Oh , no ! I did a lot of bad things this year . I hope the kitchen god isn't like Lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody ! __eou__  Actually , there's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did . __eou__
 And what happened ? __eou__  His face broke out and he said it was my fault ! __eou__
 Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company . __eou__  Can we just sit wherever we want ? __eou__
 Of course not ! We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back . __eou__  Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ? __eou__
 Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! __eou__  Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you . __eou__
 Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you . __eou__  I just hope he doesn't start bragging again ! __eou__
 I just hope he doesn't start bragging again ! __eou__  I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus ! __eou__
 I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus ! __eou__  Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ? __eou__
 He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week . __eou__  Is there some way I can get into contact with him ? __eou__
 Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w . __eou__  Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ? __eou__
 Yes . He usually replies immediately . __eou__  Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful . __eou__
 Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful . __eou__  My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him . __eou__
OK . Here's the final drawing ! It's for the trip ! __eou__  And the winner is ... Vivian , again ! I don't believe it ! __eou__
 And the winner is ... Vivian , again ! I don't believe it ! __eou__  Our red underwear didn't do any good at all ! __eou__
 Our red underwear didn't do any good at all ! __eou__  Well , there are still some consolation prizes . We can go up to the front and pick them up . __eou__
 A bar of soap ! __eou__  Look at Vivian ! She thinks she's the cat's meow ! __eou__
This'd better be good . I'm about to fire you all and find another company . __eou__  We've brought you a little something from the place down the street , Kitty Cafe-Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans ! __eou__
 We've brought you a little something from the place down the street , Kitty Cafe-Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans ! __eou__  Mmm , smells good . Sure better than my instant . But please don't tell me this is another coffee-themed pitch . I thought I told you ... __eou__
 Mmm , smells good . Sure better than my instant . But please don't tell me this is another coffee-themed pitch . I thought I told you ... __eou__  ... yes , but this one has an all-new buzz . __eou__
 That's great ... __eou__  " The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB . We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... " __eou__
Mr . Drake , I'm pleased to do business with your company . __eou__  We're glad to be able to offer our services to your business , Mrs . Wayne . __eou__
 We're glad to be able to offer our services to your business , Mrs . Wayne . __eou__  Your company is very well respected . About how long have you been in business ? __eou__
 Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California . __eou__  And this is your company's head office ? __eou__
 Well , yes , but now we have six offices in California alone . __eou__  That's wonderful . Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation ? __eou__
 That's right . We are their sole PR sector business . __eou__  That's not bad . How long have you been in PR ? __eou__
 I want a new brand image . Something creative , something strong . Make no mistake , something with ... resolve ! __eou__  What is our time frame ? __eou__
 Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! __eou__  I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . __eou__
 I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . __eou__  Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . __eou__
 Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . __eou__  It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . __eou__
 Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie ! __eou__  Exactly ! With the war in Iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . __eou__
 Exactly ! With the war in Iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . __eou__  What's next ? Tony Blair in high heels ? __eou__
 Sure . I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . __eou__  Inspiration can come in the strangest ways ... __eou__
 Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . __eou__  I see . And how about the working hours ? __eou__
 Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . __eou__  Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . __eou__
 Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . __eou__  Good , as long as you understand that . __eou__
 Good , as long as you understand that . __eou__  And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? __eou__
 I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . __eou__  Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . __eou__
 The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . __eou__  I hope to hear from you very soon . __eou__
 I hope to hear from you very soon . __eou__  Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye . __eou__
Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . __eou__  Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . __eou__
 Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . __eou__  Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__
 Yes , of course . That ’ s quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also . __eou__  I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? __eou__
 Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . __eou__  Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . __eou__
 Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . __eou__  Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ? __eou__
 Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever . __eou__  So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__
 Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . __eou__  Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__
 Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . __eou__  Okay ... __eou__
 Okay ... __eou__  I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! __eou__  What ! I resent that ! __eou__
 What ! I resent that ! __eou__  Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! __eou__
And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . __eou__  Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__
 Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__  Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__
 Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__  No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__
 No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__  Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . __eou__
 Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . __eou__  And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__
 And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__  Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__
 Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__  Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . __eou__
 Sure , it ’ s Josh O ’ Neil . __eou__  Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ? __eou__
 Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . __eou__  Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? __eou__
 Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! __eou__  Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__
 Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__  But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__
 But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__  Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! __eou__
 Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . __eou__  I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! __eou__
 I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . __eou__  I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! __eou__
 Sure , Merton Financial Advisors . __eou__  Oh , actually , Tuesday ’ s no good . Sorry about that . __eou__
Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . __eou__  Just give me a second . I'll be right up . I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! __eou__
 But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus . __eou__  Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . __eou__
 I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . __eou__  Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I " m sure something can be worked out . __eou__
 I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . __eou__  OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . __eou__
 Why ? I work very hard . __eou__  Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently . And you don't work well with other employees . __eou__
 Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently . And you don't work well with other employees . __eou__  Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . __eou__
 Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . __eou__  I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . __eou__
 I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . __eou__  It's unfair . __eou__
 It's unfair . __eou__  We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . __eou__
 It's interesting , I like being an editor . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people . __eou__  I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . __eou__
 I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . __eou__  I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . __eou__
 I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . __eou__  Do you have any complaints ? __eou__
 Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . __eou__  That's perfect . I will definitely do well . __eou__
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! __eou__  Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__  I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__
 I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__  Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . __eou__
 Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__  Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . __eou__
 In 3 months or so . __eou__  You said the same thing three months ago . __eou__
 You said the same thing three months ago . __eou__  Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  I got the message . I'm quiting . __eou__
 Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . __eou__  I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . __eou__
 I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . __eou__  I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . __eou__
 I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . __eou__  Very well , consider me gone . __eou__
 Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . __eou__  Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . __eou__
 Not bad . Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . __eou__  I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . __eou__

 It ’ s the job I ’ m interested in . And your company is the best-known . Although I don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . It ’ s a job I ’ Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it . __eou__  Oh , really ? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ? __eou__
 I don ’ t think so . As the saying goes , “ A great oak needs deep roots . ” I ’ m really interested in this job . __eou__  That ’ s fine . Thanks for coming to see us . I hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week . __eou__
Welcome to our company . __eou__  I really love this kind of atmosphere . __eou__

 An impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company . __eou__  There are people everywhere . What's that girl doing ? __eou__
 She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network . __eou__  And what about that man there ? __eou__
 He is our accountant . __eou__  I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employees . __eou__

 First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record . Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business . __eou__  Now you are with Quandong Company . What is your chief responsibility there ? __eou__
 I'm in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions . __eou__  Do you have any questions about the job ? __eou__
 Certainly . This is an international company , and ther're good chances for you to work overseas . __eou__  That would be good . __eou__
 My name is Woody . __eou__  OK , Woody . Why are you interested in this job ? __eou__
 Because I admire your company . Yours is one of the most effective and respectable companies in this city . __eou__  Have you worked anywhere else before ? __eou__
 Yes , five years ago . I began to work in a fashion company in Shanghai . Two years ago , I came to Beijing , and worked in a department store as a salesman . __eou__  OK , your work experience is impressive , and I think you sound right for this position , but I do have 3 other people to interview , so you'll be hearing from us within a week . __eou__
 I want a job in which I can use English , I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work . __eou__  I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs . __eou__
 Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday . __eou__  Have you had any experience as a guide ? __eou__
 Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing . __eou__  Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing . __eou__

 Yes , I have an ACRE certificate , Bank 2 . __eou__  Do you know how to use a PC to process the management information ? __eou__
 I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . __eou__  Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ? __eou__
 Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . __eou__  It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field . __eou__

 I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done . __eou__  Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__
 I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . __eou__  What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? __eou__

 All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % . __eou__  That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ? __eou__
 I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future . __eou__  Have you received any honors ? __eou__
 Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 . __eou__  Do you have any publications ? __eou__
 Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French . __eou__  You mean you can read and write both of them ? __eou__
 No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . __eou__  Can you read and write English well ? __eou__
 I can speak the language better than read and write . __eou__  Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ? __eou__
 I think so . I used to be an interpreter . __eou__  Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ? __eou__
 Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . __eou__  Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? __eou__
 Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . __eou__  What would you say is your most positive quality ? __eou__
 Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . __eou__  So , what changed ? __eou__
 Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . __eou__  Wow , a real step up ! __eou__
 Wow , a real step up ! __eou__  Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent restaurant years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__
 Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent restaurant years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__  I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__
 Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . __eou__  Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . __eou__  Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed school . __eou__
 Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed school . __eou__  Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? __eou__
 Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student newspaper , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . __eou__  What did that involve ? __eou__
 Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . __eou__  I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? __eou__
 My name is Zhuang Lingy . How are you , Miss Kelly ? __eou__  I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . __eou__
 I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute . __eou__  Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ? __eou__
 For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalistic world , and this seemed like a good first step . __eou__  Certainly . And after your internship ? __eou__
 They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really enjoyed it there , and it really helped me build my skills . __eou__  Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 , right ? __eou__
 Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . __eou__  The London Weekly right ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen . __eou__  Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? __eou__
 Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too . __eou__  Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . __eou__
 Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . __eou__  Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . __eou__

 I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . __eou__  What kind of things did you need to check ? __eou__
 The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so they get special prices . __eou__  I see . Did anything else happen ? __eou__
 I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and requirements . __eou__  It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . __eou__
 It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . __eou__  Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint from a client . __eou__
 Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint from a client . __eou__  I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? __eou__
 Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__  You certainly had a busy day . __eou__
 You certainly had a busy day . __eou__  That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . __eou__
 I want to work in the banking industry . I ’ Ve always been interesting in working for an international invest bank . I ’ d like to help people invest their money . __eou__  That ’ s a job that pays well . If you ’ re lucky , you might have opportunities to travel as well . Have you applied to any banks yet ? Our course will end soon . __eou__
 Yes . I ’ Ve sent letters to several banks . A few have invited me for interviews after we take our examinations . __eou__  Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet . __eou__
 Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet . __eou__  Which field would you like to work in ? have you decide yet ? __eou__
 I ’ d like to work in marketing . I think I could have a good career in that field . __eou__  Perhaps you should apply to banks as well . They need people to market their service . As you said , the banking industry pays well . __eou__
 Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . __eou__  What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? __eou__
 They are all listed here on this sheet of paper . __eou__  Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ? __eou__
 Unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers . __eou__  Alright . What if I can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ? __eou__
 They should have then listed on their resumes . __eou__  And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ? __eou__
 Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up . __eou__  Did you leave a voice message ? __eou__
 I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list . __eou__  I see . What did you tell her ? __eou__
 I told her that she should call me back at my office number . __eou__  Ok , so , maybe I should call her again . __eou__
 Great work . I ’ m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday . __eou__  See you . __eou__
 He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair . __eou__  Is there anything else ? __eou__
 He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion . __eou__  How old is he ? __eou__
 He is in his late thirties . __eou__  Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ? __eou__
 yes , I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow . __eou__  How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . __eou__
 How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . __eou__  That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ? __eou__
 Excuse me for taking your time . __eou__  Oh . It's nothing Navy . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I __eou__  Do you think I believe the story like that ? __eou__
 But it's true . __eou__  How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? __eou__
 That's coincident 。 __eou__  Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。 __eou__
 The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . __eou__  Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? __eou__
 Yes , it is not easy . __eou__  It is ok with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things . __eou__
 It was pretty bumpy , also a bit long , all together about 5 hours . __eou__  That is a long flight . You had a layover too , is that right ? You must be tired . __eou__
 Actually I feel quite rested . I was able to sleep on the plane . __eou__  Good ! Here , let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it . __eou__
 Oh , no , I'v already made several trips to Guangzhou , this is my first trip to Beijing though.It is a lot larger than I expected it would be . __eou__  Yes , Beijing has been grown over the last few years , there are a lot of improvements and changes being made for the Olympics . What would you like to see changing be made for Olympic , what would you like to see when are you here ? __eou__
 What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . __eou__  The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . __eou__
 The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . __eou__  You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? __eou__
 You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? __eou__  It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ? __eou__
 Attention all staff ... Effective immediately , all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos.The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited . __eou__  Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ? __eou__
 It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications . __eou__  But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients . __eou__
 But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients . __eou__  They will just have to change their communication methods . I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office.It wastes too much time ! Now , please continue with the memo.Where were we ? __eou__
 This applies to internal and external communications . __eou__  Yes.Any employee who persists in using Instant Messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation.At second offense , the employee will face termination.Any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads . __eou__
 Yes.Any employee who persists in using Instant Messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation.At second offense , the employee will face termination.Any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads . __eou__  Is that all ? __eou__
Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . __eou__  Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . __eou__
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . __eou__  Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__
 Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__  When will we get one of those ? __eou__
 Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__
 You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__  This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? __eou__
 The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__  Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . __eou__
Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees . __eou__  I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track . __eou__
 I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track . __eou__  Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ? __eou__
I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . __eou__  To visit our supplier ? __eou__
 Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . __eou__  Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . __eou__
 Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . __eou__  I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? __eou__
... Now , that's all I want to say about world coal reserves . So let's move on to the next topic , renewable resources . There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources . First , sustainability ; second , marketability ; lastly , the reality factor . Let's talk about each point in more detail ... John , would you like to take it from here ? __eou__  Certainly . As my colleague just mentioned , sustainability is a major concern when examining the potential output of a resource . Of course , as you can see from the content of our presentation today , with renewable resource , there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  I am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . Could you please come for the final round ? It is scheduled on the morning of next Monday 10AM in the HR manager office . __eou__
 Ok , see you then , bye . __eou__  Bye . __eou__
 Thanks , Vivian . __eou__  No problem at all . Welcome . __eou__
 Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ’ Ve got to be there , right ? __eou__  Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__
 I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . __eou__  It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . __eou__
 Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . __eou__  Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? __eou__
 I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-step research before I send my application letters out . __eou__  That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . __eou__
Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . __eou__  Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__
 Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__  I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__
 Perfect . Our offer remains open for 3 days . __eou__  I don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . If your prices are agreeable and if I can get the commission I want , I can place the order right away . __eou__
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much . __eou__  I ’ m glad to hear that . As I ’ Ve just said , I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . __eou__
We did a survey on your job performance . __eou__  How did I do ? __eou__
 Not so good . Lots of complains . __eou__  Really ? I thought I was doing well . __eou__
 About 3-4 % of the gross sales . __eou__  What ’ s that building opposite us ? __eou__
 That ’ s the warehouse . We keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . __eou__  If I placed an order now , how long would it be before I got delivery ? __eou__
 Not bad . But there is more room for improvement . __eou__  I jumped the gun . __eou__
 I jumped the gun . __eou__  There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow . __eou__
 As a rule we don ’ t allow any commission . But if the order is a substantial one , we ’ ll consider it . __eou__  You see , but I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even two or three percent would help . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again ! __eou__  Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . __eou__
 Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . __eou__  After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? __eou__
 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. __eou__  Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ? __eou__
 We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day . __eou__  Is there probation ? __eou__
 That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 I second . __eou__  motion carried . Now , next on our agenda is our budget review . Margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? __eou__
 I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . We've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . Here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . Basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left . __eou__  What kind of action is required ? __eou__
 You ’ ll have 10 days paid vacation every year . __eou__  What about the insurance and housing policies ? __eou__
 We will provide you wit life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . __eou__  How often is the bonus ? __eou__
 You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . __eou__  Do I have training opportunities ? __eou__
 We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . __eou__  Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think a couple of days before I give you my final answer . __eou__
 Ok , thank you for your time and patience . __eou__  You ’ re welcome . __eou__
 Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market ! __eou__  Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . __eou__
 It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . __eou__  Do you think it's that serious ? __eou__
 Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep . __eou__  My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad . __eou__
 This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . __eou__  Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? __eou__
 Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . __eou__  Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? __eou__
 Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . All together , there will be 15 events . __eou__  What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... __eou__
 It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . __eou__  Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? __eou__
 We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . __eou__  Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? __eou__
 Let's see ... You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean , and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . __eou__  Fine . We will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__
 We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . __eou__  What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ? __eou__
The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . __eou__  Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . __eou__
 Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . __eou__  Why is the price so high ? __eou__
 It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . __eou__  Model of computers aren't compatible ? __eou__
 Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . __eou__  Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . __eou__
 Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . __eou__  But by then , the technology will be outdated . __eou__
 But by then , the technology will be outdated . __eou__  True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . __eou__
 True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . __eou__  That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . __eou__
 That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . __eou__  This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . __eou__
 This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . __eou__  I guess you get what you pay for . __eou__
 Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . __eou__  That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . __eou__
 From eleven thirty to 1 o ’ clock . __eou__  May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? __eou__
 Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! __eou__  Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . __eou__
 Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . __eou__  Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . __eou__
 Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . __eou__  Really ? What could that be ? __eou__
 Thank you for telling me that . __eou__  But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . __eou__
 But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . __eou__  What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . __eou__
 No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . __eou__  Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . __eou__
Hello . __eou__  Hi , Lucy , are you free to talk ? __eou__
 I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job . __eou__  Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ? __eou__
 I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system . __eou__  How do you work with a team ? __eou__
 I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members . __eou__  What ’ s your long term goal ? __eou__
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__  So you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . __eou__  Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? __eou__
 Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . __eou__  I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__
 I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__  So you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . __eou__  Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? __eou__
 Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . __eou__  I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! __eou__
 I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! __eou__  Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . __eou__
 Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . __eou__  Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it ! __eou__
 Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it ! __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ? __eou__  Yes , I want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases . I want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ... __eou__
 You ’ re welcome . For the moment , I have no further questions . I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time . __eou__  We will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue with you or not . __eou__
 They are reports of our company . __eou__  Are they filed alphabetically ? __eou__
 No , they are filed according to dates . __eou__  Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? __eou__
 I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . __eou__  Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . __eou__
 Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . __eou__  That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . __eou__
 That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . __eou__  At lease they stayed the same . That's better than dropping . __eou__
I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . __eou__  It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . __eou__
 It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . __eou__  Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . __eou__
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . __eou__  What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? __eou__
 Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? __eou__  Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . __eou__
 It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . __eou__  Ok , home or office address ? __eou__
 Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . __eou__  Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? __eou__
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . __eou__  Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . __eou__
Hello , this is Francis . __eou__  Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . __eou__
 Today , I am busy all day long . __eou__  Shall I see you on Friday morning ? __eou__
 I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__  Other company rules also need your attention . __eou__
 Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__  Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
 The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . __eou__  Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? __eou__
 Yes , it is not easy . __eou__  It is ok with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things . __eou__
 Yes , it is . __eou__  I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . __eou__
 Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__  I see . What can I do now ? __eou__
The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . __eou__  Why , what's the lowdown ? __eou__
 According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . __eou__  I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . __eou__
 Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager . __eou__  Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office . Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today . __eou__
 Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . __eou__  I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__
 No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . __eou__  You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? __eou__
 You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? __eou__  The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week . __eou__
 Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . __eou__  Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__
Last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . Our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website . __eou__  If we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast . __eou__
 From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market . __eou__  Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough . __eou__
 Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough . __eou__  here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ... __eou__
 here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ... __eou__  Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with . __eou__
 Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with . __eou__  We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market . __eou__
 We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market . __eou__  Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we . __eou__
 First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . __eou__  Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? __eou__
 I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . __eou__  So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? __eou__
 I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . __eou__  Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? __eou__
 The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . __eou__  So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? __eou__
 Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . __eou__  Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . __eou__
 Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . __eou__  In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . __eou__
 We got numbers back from our offices in Beijing , Hong Kong , Taipei , Singapore and Tokyo , we're waiting on Bangkok and Kula Lumpur . __eou__  What do the preliminary figures tell you ? Any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the Far East ? __eou__
 It's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets . __eou__  For example ? __eou__
Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . __eou__  Hello , Lucy . __eou__
 Hello , Lucy . __eou__  I ’ m calling to see if you have made your decision . You are the right person we are seeking for . __eou__
 It ’ s my honor to be one member of your company . I ’ d like to begin to work any time as you like . __eou__  Ok , please come to my office at 9 AM next Monday . I will introduce you to our boss . __eou__
Thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . Today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare . __eou__  Employee welfare ? What all does that include ? __eou__
 In the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations . __eou__  What kind of considerations are we talking about ? __eou__
 It is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights . We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . Let ’ s all welcome Ms . Michelle Cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman . __eou__  Our company now has n ombudsman ? __eou__
 A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement . __eou__  Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ? __eou__
 Retirement age is still 65 , but I think more and more people are retiring earlier , I think Bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young . __eou__  Wow ... I thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ? __eou__
 Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese . __eou__  Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion . __eou__
 Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . __eou__  What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... __eou__
 You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . __eou__  So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? __eou__
 Managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility , or who has anyone working under them . It includes all supervisors and department heads . __eou__  What about the senior account managers ? Do they count ? __eou__
 No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . __eou__  How many people are on the board of directors ? __eou__
 Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . __eou__  What's he studying ? __eou__
 He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA . __eou__  Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? __eou__
 The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . __eou__  Why is that ? __eou__
 Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure . __eou__  Could you tell me something about it ? __eou__
 Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company . __eou__  How many departments do we have ? __eou__
 Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch . __eou__  Ok . Who should I report to ? __eou__
So , where can I start my work ? __eou__  Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports . __eou__
 Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research . __eou__  So , what experience do you have ? __eou__
 I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department . __eou__  I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ? __eou__
 I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new . __eou__  I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? __eou__
 I would rather work full-time . __eou__  I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? __eou__
 It is 15 minutes ’ drive . __eou__  What companies do we have in our neighborhood ? __eou__
 Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations . __eou__  Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ? __eou__
 Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building . __eou__  It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ? __eou__
 Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . __eou__  What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? __eou__
 I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... __eou__  Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? __eou__
 Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . __eou__  I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? __eou__
It is really exciting news . __eou__  What news ? __eou__
 You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . __eou__  You know what we will get ? __eou__
 We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . __eou__  What docking station ? __eou__
 This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . __eou__  Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . __eou__
 Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . __eou__  I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__
 Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__  Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__
 Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__  Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__
 Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__  But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__
 But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__  Well , keep a low profile . __eou__
 Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__  I see . What can I do now ? __eou__
 Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . __eou__  It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . __eou__
 It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . __eou__  You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . __eou__
 You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . __eou__  Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . __eou__
 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . __eou__  Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? __eou__
 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . __eou__  I didn ’ t pay attention to that . __eou__
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__  So you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . __eou__  Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? __eou__
 They are reports of our company . __eou__  Are they filed alphabetically ? __eou__
 No , they are filed according to dates . __eou__  Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? __eou__
 Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . __eou__  Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . __eou__
 Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . __eou__  Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . __eou__

If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . __eou__  Ok , then we can sign up for it together . __eou__
 Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . __eou__  But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? __eou__
 It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . __eou__  That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . __eou__
 That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . __eou__  Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . __eou__
 Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . __eou__  But if the company asks , what else can we do ? __eou__
 No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . __eou__  Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . __eou__
 I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . __eou__  You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . __eou__
 You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . __eou__  Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee . __eou__
 Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee . __eou__  Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? __eou__
 An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . __eou__  You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . __eou__
 You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . __eou__  But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__
 But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__  That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . __eou__
I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . __eou__  You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . __eou__
 Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . __eou__  Totally agree . What is your solution ? __eou__
 Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . __eou__  You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . __eou__
 You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . __eou__  It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . __eou__
 It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . __eou__  But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . __eou__
 But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . __eou__  I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . __eou__
I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . __eou__  To visit our supplier ? __eou__
 Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . __eou__  Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . __eou__
 No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . __eou__  Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . __eou__
 Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! __eou__  Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . __eou__
 Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . __eou__  Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . __eou__
 Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . __eou__  Really ? What could that be ? __eou__
 It was a nightmare . __eou__  What ’ s up ? __eou__
 Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__  Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__
 Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__  This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__
 I am still waiting for their call . __eou__  Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . __eou__
 I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract . __eou__  Can I see it for a second ? __eou__
 Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . As we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details . __eou__  Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? __eou__
 The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... __eou__  Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . You should give them another call . __eou__
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this . __eou__  Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so . __eou__
 I think I can handle it by myself . __eou__  I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__
 I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__  Other company rules also need your attention . __eou__
 Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . __eou__  Yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__
 Yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__  Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
 Like Regarding our new product line , we would like to announce a special price discount __eou__  Right , do you need them to respond ? __eou__
 Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! __eou__  That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . __eou__
 That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . __eou__  What was so bad about it ? __eou__
 Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . __eou__  Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . __eou__
 Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . __eou__  Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . __eou__
 Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . __eou__  That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . __eou__
 From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock . __eou__  May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? __eou__
 Thank you for telling me that . __eou__  But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . __eou__
 But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . __eou__  What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . __eou__
 It should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . All together our tour should last about half an hour . __eou__  Okay ... __eou__
 Okay ... __eou__  Well , if you don't have any questions , shall we get started ? If you'll follow me , first I'll take you to the site of our semi-conductor system ... __eou__
 Yes , but this one will have to be re-faxed as well . And look , there's about three pages missing ! It looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes , and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light , they're unreadable ! __eou__  I guess the fax machine is out of paper , too . Don't worry , I'll have someone look at it this afternoon , and in the meantime , I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine . __eou__
 It should be under Leslie Smith . The number is 184796 A . __eou__  Yes , Mr . Smith . I have an order for three cases of cartridges , it that what you would like to refill ? __eou__
 Oh , that's right . You are supposed to deliver a brief on that account tomorrow . I know there are some things I need to share with you about that . But , gosh , I don't know ... Things are really busy for me today , the only time I can manage to squeeze out might be over lunch break ... __eou__  I hate to make you work through your lunch break with how busy you are ... __eou__
 I hate to make you work through your lunch break with how busy you are ... __eou__  It's okay ... I've already had several days in a row working through lunch ... __eou__
 It's okay ... I've already had several days in a row working through lunch ... __eou__  How about this ... We can make it a working lunch this afternoon , and I'll order some Chinese food for delivery . It'll be my treat . __eou__
Hello ! __eou__  Hello , is Doris available ? __eou__

I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . __eou__  What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? __eou__
I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . __eou__  It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . __eou__
 Yes , that ’ s right . __eou__  I ’ ll get them for you at once . And could I file the report for you ? __eou__
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . __eou__  Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . __eou__
Mr . White , I would like to give you notice that I will be leaving the company . It will be effective at the beginning of the next month . __eou__  Jessica , I am very sorry to hear that . Why are you leaving ? __eou__

 Form your company's advertisement in the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY , I learn that you are a foreign trade company of good service . I am interested in it.Here is my resume , ma'am . __eou__  Very good , you majored in International Trade ? __eou__
 Yes , I will graduate from the People's University of China this July majoring in International Trade.Besides , at school , I am a top student.Moreover , both my spoken and written English are pretty good . __eou__  Well , for this position , we prefer experienced employees , Those who have just graduated from university , they are supposed to start by working as an intern for at least half a year . __eou__
 Well , for this position , we prefer experienced employees , Those who have just graduated from university , they are supposed to start by working as an intern for at least half a year . __eou__  I think I ' m qualified for the job if I can be given the chance.While at school , I once worked as part-time translator in a company and salesperson with a textile company for two years.And I don't mind being paid less from the start , I just want to enrich my experience and competence . __eou__
 I think I ' m qualified for the job if I can be given the chance.While at school , I once worked as part-time translator in a company and salesperson with a textile company for two years.And I don't mind being paid less from the start , I just want to enrich my experience and competence . __eou__  Good.That is the kind of man we are looking for.By the way , do you like traveling ? Our sales representatives need to travel a lot . __eou__
 Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer . __eou__  Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ? __eou__
 Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation . __eou__  If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ? __eou__
 I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility . __eou__  Are you able to operate the telex ? __eou__
 Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information . __eou__  Now can you tell me if you have a good command of both written and spoken English ? __eou__
 When I was college , I passed Band Six of College English Test.All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good . __eou__  If you are selected for the position , you must prepare to travel overseas frequently . __eou__
 Sure . Actually it's a routine board meeting . The things to be discussed are all written here . __eou__  Very good . May I keep it ? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda . __eou__
 Exactly . As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting , I don't want it to get out of control . __eou__  I see . Ok , then where do you think we will have the meeting ? __eou__
 Yes , I will see that the room is ready by Friday . And I will check there are enough chairs , and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right . __eou__  Good , and please get some water , glasses and ash tray ready as well . __eou__
 But I am not familiar with the members of the board . __eou__  Oh , that's easy . I will write you a list of their names . You can make a seating plan with the names and give each one a number . __eou__
 I know it ’ s so costly , but ... __eou__  No buts . The thing is to cut down your expense , Judie . __eou__
Well Mr . Black , I appreciate your interest in our company , but I doubt you can do this job properly . __eou__  I ’ m sure I can do it well . I ’ Ve always wanted to be the best in whatever I did . Give me a chance . __eou__

 Thank you.that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it . __eou__  Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place calledWild Things ? ! __eou__
 I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . __eou__  What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? __eou__
 Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . __eou__  Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? __eou__
 There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . __eou__  Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . __eou__
 I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . __eou__  What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__
 My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . __eou__  Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . __eou__
 I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . __eou__  When do you find a job satisfying ? __eou__
 My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . __eou__  How would your coworkers describe you ? __eou__
 First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously . __eou__  Do you have any questions ? __eou__
 I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement . __eou__  Why do you think you might like to work for our company ? __eou__
 I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field . __eou__  What makes you think you would be a success in this position ? __eou__
 My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful . __eou__  How do you know about this company ? __eou__
 Well , I am always energetic and enthusiastic . That's my strongest personality . __eou__  What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__
 Em , as I have said , I'm diligent and industrious . On the other hand , sometimes I'm too hard-working and I put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect . __eou__  What qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ? __eou__
 To work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . That is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive . __eou__  How do you spend your leisure time ? __eou__
 I like playing games and having sports . They are my favourite hobbies . __eou__  So , what kind of sport do you like most ? __eou__
 My name is Dunlin and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I will graduate from Peking University this July . I have majored in accounting . __eou__  Would you tell me something about your family ? __eou__
 Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person . __eou__  What is your strongest trait ? __eou__
 Cheerfulness and friendliness . __eou__  How would your friends or colleagues describe you ? __eou__
 They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person . __eou__  What personality do you admire ? __eou__
 I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going . __eou__  How do you get along with others ? __eou__
Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! __eou__  Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__
 Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . __eou__  Uh-huh . __eou__
 Uh-huh . __eou__  But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around 16 . __eou__  Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? __eou__
 Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business __eou__  Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . __eou__
 Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . __eou__  Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . __eou__
 Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . __eou__  I see . Okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? __eou__
I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! __eou__  No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__
 Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . __eou__  Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? __eou__
 Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . __eou__  Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ... __eou__
 Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ... __eou__  That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__
 Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__  Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__
 Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__  Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__
 I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . __eou__  Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? __eou__
 Yes , it's me . __eou__  Do you have a cold ? __eou__
 No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . __eou__  Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? __eou__
 I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . __eou__  I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? __eou__
 Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . __eou__  Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? __eou__
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__  That bad , huh ? __eou__
 Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . __eou__  Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__
 Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . __eou__  Hope you feel better . __eou__
Excuse me , sir , this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer . It looks like you have more than fifteen items there . __eou__  Oh , come on ! I have sixteen items ! Cut me some slack , will ya ? __eou__
 Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway . __eou__  Do you have a club card or will it be cash ? __eou__
And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . __eou__  I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . __eou__
 I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . __eou__  Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . __eou__
 Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . __eou__  No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... __eou__
 I have learned English for 10 years , and I have passed College English Test Band 4 and 6.My spoken English is fairly good enough to express myself fluently . __eou__  What other foreign language do you speak ? __eou__

It has been very successful in an expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago . Working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge I am looking for . __eou__  Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? __eou__

Very good . Now , I have a couple of final questions . __eou__  I hope they ’ re not too hard ! __eou__
 I hope they ’ re not too hard ! __eou__  Well , why should we hire you ? __eou__
 I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company . I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen , and outstanding soft skills . you know , I excel at building strong , long-term customer relationships . For example , when I headed the customer support department in my previous company , our team solved about seventy percent of our customers ’ problems . I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products , so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department , we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers ’ issues . Given the opportunity , I could bring this kind of success to this company . __eou__  Impressive ! So , what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ? __eou__
 I struggle with organization and time management . Punctuality has never been a strength of mine . I find it hard to organize my time efficiently . I have actually addressed this weakness recently , by attending a workshop on efficient time management . It helped me a lot , by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently , so I think I ’ m getting better now . __eou__  Great ...

 Yes . I have worked part-time at a take away food store-the one just round the corner . __eou__  We have a lot of other applicants for this position . Why do you think that you deserve to get the job ? __eou__

They ’ re true industry leaders , and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development . __eou__
 I know ! It ’ s an amazing growth opportunity ! They ’ re true industry leaders , and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development . __eou__  So , let ’ s see , you did your research on the company , right ? __eou__
 Well , I visited their website and read up on what they do . They ’ re an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations . They provide services such as ARM development , and they also offer customdesigned applications . __eou__  So what would your role in the company ? __eou__
 Well , the position is for an account manager . That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team . __eou__  Sounds good , and so , why do you want to work with them ? __eou__
 Well , as I said they ’ re the industry leaders , they have a really great growth strategy , amazing development opportunities for employees , and it seems like they have strong corporate governance . They ’ re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential . I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me . Oh , and they offer six weeks ’ vacation , stock options and bonuses ... I ’ m totally going to cash in on that . __eou__  You idiot ! Don ’ t say that ! Do you want this job , or not ? __eou__
 Sure ! Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology . __eou__  Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ? __eou__
 Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area . I also strive to keep my professional skills current , so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service . __eou__  Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle . __eou__
 Yeah , I worked as their customer support manager , which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care , and process management . I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction . __eou__  Interesting ... __eou__
 Interesting ... __eou__  Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue . __eou__
 Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . __eou__  Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? __eou__
 Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable.Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! __eou__  Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__
 Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__  But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__
 But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__  Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! __eou__
 Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . __eou__  I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! __eou__
 I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . __eou__  I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! __eou__
 I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company . I interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses .

 Yes , I can . I have received some special training in computers . Besides I am good at operating common office machines , such as fax machines and duplicating machines . __eou__  Sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . How do you feel about that ? __eou__
 It just depends . If we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . It's not unusual . __eou__  Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question . __eou__
 Yes . I specialized in English secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job . __eou__  What are your salary expectations ? __eou__
 The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence . __eou__  I think it's acceptable and I really like the job . And when can I know the decision ? __eou__
 Oh , to tell you the truth , I love the sky . When I was a child , I imagined flying into the blue sky some day . Now , I think the day has come . My dream will come true . And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people . __eou__  Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty ? __eou__
 Yes , I think I am quite fluent in English . I got the certificate of the Secondary English Training last month . __eou__  Do you know what the responsibilities are for a stewardess ? __eou__

 My height is one meter and sixty-eight centimeters . I've never had any vision problems . __eou__  What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__
 One of my strengths is my friendliness and open-minded attitude and also I think I have a warm personality . But sometimes , I find it is hard to tell others when I don't like what they are doing . __eou__  If a passenger can't understand what you say , what should you do ? __eou__
 I ’ m sorry . She ’ s in a meeting right now . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 I see . __eou__  Can I give her a message for you ? __eou__

 My work involves various routine bookkeeping and basic accounting tasks including journal entries , verifying data and reconciling discrepancies , preparing detailed reports from raw data , and checking accounting documents for completeness , mathematical accuracy and consistency . __eou__  Are you familiar with the PRC Financial and Tax Regulations ? __eou__
 I think so . __eou__  Can you tell me something about this balance sheet now ? __eou__
 Of course . This balance sheet contains three major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . So , you see , the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372 , 000 , and the owner's equity is $ 5,400 , 000 . That means that the total assets , which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities , are $ 8,772 , 000 . __eou__  What's the creditor's equity ? __eou__
 Good morning , Mrs Smith . __eou__  Good morning . You are Mr . Sun , aren't you ? Take a seat , please . __eou__
 In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting , and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting , Commercial Accounting , Industrial Accounting , and Management Accounting . __eou__  Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control ? __eou__
 No , we haven't taken such a course , but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making , by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making . __eou__  From your school report card , I can see you did well in every course . But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience . __eou__
 From your school report card , I can see you did well in every course . But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience . __eou__  I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume .

Here is the recommendation . __eou__
 I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume . In fact , I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year . I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well . Here is the recommendation . __eou__  You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English . __eou__

When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English . __eou__  That sounds fine . Why did you choose to apply to our company ? __eou__

 No , I know how to control my temper . __eou__  If a passenger had a accident , what would you do ? __eou__
 I would give him or her basic first aid and ask my partner to call for assistance at the same time . __eou__  If you are hired , when can you start work ? __eou__

 I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . __eou__  That sounds very reasonable . __eou__
 That sounds very reasonable . __eou__  It's the most important thing to me . __eou__
 It's the most important thing to me . __eou__  If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ? __eou__
 That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me . __eou__  Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them . __eou__

 By doing everything necessary and for further study . __eou__  How long would you like to stay with this company ? __eou__
 How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other . __eou__  What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ? __eou__
 My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year . __eou__  What are your salary expectations now ? __eou__
 I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year . __eou__  That's a little more than we had planned . __eou__
 That's a little more than we had planned . __eou__  I think you'll find I'm worth that . __eou__
 To speak frankly , it doesn't depend on me . __eou__  How so ? __eou__
 I really want to obtain a permanent job . I won't leave as long as I have opportunity to apply my knowledge and get on well with my superiors and colleagues . __eou__  What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? __eou__

 I have worked on about every system that is out right now . __eou__  Do you feel comfortable with the new system by microcosm ? __eou__
 I am not as familiar with it as I am with some of the older systems . But I am a fast learner and I can master it in a short time . __eou__  What do you consider your strengths ? __eou__
 Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ... __eou__  Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy . __eou__
 Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy . __eou__  You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ? __eou__
 Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it . __eou__  Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great . __eou__
 But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job . __eou__  Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them . __eou__
 Oh , no . What did I do ? It ’ s asking me for a password . __eou__  Don ’ t worry . See where it says , “ New User ” ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Click on that . __eou__
 I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work . __eou__  That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out . __eou__
 No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to . __eou__  We can ’ t really ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ? __eou__
 No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you . __eou__  How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? __eou__
 With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . __eou__  Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . __eou__
 You have some doubts about our products , I understand . __eou__  I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . __eou__
 Yes , of course . __eou__  Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . __eou__
 Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . __eou__  And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . __eou__
 And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . __eou__  That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . __eou__
 That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . __eou__  So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . __eou__
 So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . __eou__  Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . __eou__
 Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . __eou__  I understand . But why won't you show me the logo ? __eou__
 Because it hasn't been copyrighted . We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products . __eou__  I see . The problem , however , is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last . __eou__
 I see . The problem , however , is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last . __eou__  I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . __eou__
 Alright . I understand . Right now you just want estimates . __eou__  Yes . __eou__
 I want to find information on the American Civil War . __eou__  Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that . __eou__
 Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg . __eou__  O . K . Well , go to google.com , and type in “ Battle of Gettysburg . ” __eou__
 Oh wow , there are a lot of sites . __eou__  Here , try this one . It ’ s a good site about Gettysburg . __eou__
 Yes , it's me . __eou__  Do you have a cold ? __eou__
 No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . __eou__  Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? __eou__
 I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . __eou__  I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? __eou__
 Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . __eou__  Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? __eou__
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__  That bad , huh ? __eou__
 Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . __eou__  Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__
 Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . __eou__  Hope you feel better . __eou__
 I am disappointed with your work lately . __eou__  I'm sorry . I've been having some problems . __eou__
 I got laid off today . __eou__  Oh no ! That ’ s terrible ! __eou__
 Oh no ! That ’ s terrible ! __eou__  Yeah . __eou__
 Yeah . __eou__  What happened ? __eou__
 My boss said I didn ’ t have enough skills to do the job well . __eou__  What are you going to do ? __eou__

 Then you may know that it's hard work . __eou__  Yes , I know . A friend of mine is a guide . He talked with me about his work , but I don't mind working hard . __eou__
 Yes , I know . A friend of mine is a guide . He talked with me about his work , but I don't mind working hard . __eou__  Have you applied with any other companies ? __eou__
 No , this is my first . __eou__  Is there anything you want to ask about ? __eou__
 Certainly . There'll be a good chance of that if you work for this company . Not right away , of course , but in a few years , after you learn more about our business , you may go overseas with a tour group . Any questions ? __eou__  Yes . When can I get the decision ? I hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible . If I'd turned down , I ll have to secure a position elsewhere . __eou__
 Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__  Good-bye . __eou__
 In three months or so ? __eou__  You said the same thing three months ago . __eou__

 Yes . One more is needed . __eou__  Oh , I'm so lucky . I want to apply for it . __eou__
 Yes . I have been a guide for two years . __eou__  OK.Then I want to ask you some questions about the tourist guide.If there wasn accident , for example a tourist falls ill , what would you do ? __eou__
 I think I will call the office to send someone to meet us , and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip . __eou__  If one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant , would you let the tourist bus go back ? __eou__
 No . In fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , I will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings . __eou__  Well , it seems that you have all the practical experience to handle these cases . I am very glad to welcome you into our company . __eou__
 Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . __eou__  I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . __eou__

 That's strange . __eou__  Where do you go for lunch around here ? __eou__
 Not too bad . But I will be soon . __eou__  I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel . __eou__
 I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel . __eou__  I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ? __eou__
 Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . __eou__  I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable . __eou__
 I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable . __eou__  When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ? __eou__
 I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster . __eou__  That's what I was afraid of . __eou__
 That's what I was afraid of . __eou__  It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud . __eou__
 It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud . __eou__  Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango . __eou__

 I'm sorry , sir . __eou__  It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ? __eou__

 Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . __eou__  Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? __eou__
 No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . __eou__  Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? __eou__
 It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . __eou__  Yes . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . __eou__
 You mean because people have to go across town to get here . __eou__  Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . __eou__
 Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . __eou__  That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . __eou__
 That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . __eou__  I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . __eou__
 I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . __eou__  I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . __eou__
 I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . __eou__  Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . __eou__
 Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . __eou__  I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . " __eou__
 John eng __eou__  Hold the line , please.Mr Wood is in the meeting with managing director at the moment I afraid.Can I help you ? __eou__
 I don't think the meet will go on much longer , should I ask him to call you when he is free . __eou__  Yes , that will be easiest . __eou__
 Yes , that will be easiest . __eou__  Could I have your name again , please ? __eou__
 Yes , It's John eng . __eou__  And the number ? __eou__
 01088256798 __eou__  Ok , you will be hearing from Mr Wood later in the afternoon then , Mr John . __eou__
You look tired . __eou__  Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately . __eou__
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately . __eou__  Really ? How come ? __eou__
 My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult ! __eou__  You shouldn ’ t work so hard . __eou__
 Oh , great , I saw a job ad outside your store . I am interested in the job advertised . I am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me . __eou__  All right.Take a seat , please.Would you like to be a shop assistant or a cashier ? __eou__
 I see . I will try my best to do the job well . __eou__  That is good of you to say so.When can you start working ? __eou__
 8826789 4 , extension to 208 __eou__  When will you reach there ? __eou__
 About ten.another thing is that I want an appointment with the customer at Changing hotel at three thirty this afternoon.please help me phone the customer so we can confirm now . __eou__  What is the customer's name , and what is his room number ? __eou__
 I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . __eou__  What things impress you in your colleagues ? __eou__
 I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . __eou__  What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? __eou__
 The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . __eou__  How do you organize and plan for major projects ? __eou__
 I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . __eou__  Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . __eou__
 I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . __eou__  How do you manage your time in a typical day ? __eou__
 I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . __eou__  Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . __eou__
 Yes . But he is meeting a client . __eou__  Oh , that's too bad . I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital . She is going to deliver a baby . I must take the day off to go to the hospital . May I talk to him to ask for leave ? __eou__
 This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company . __eou__  I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ? __eou__
 Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush . __eou__  You are welcome . __eou__
 Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk . __eou__  The pile is over ten feet high . I am afraid it will fall all over and bury you underneath it if I put this file on top of it . __eou__
 The pile is over ten feet high . I am afraid it will fall all over and bury you underneath it if I put this file on top of it . __eou__  Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? __eou__
 What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . __eou__  Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway . __eou__
This is a very good meeting , Liz . __eou__  I am happy that we ’ Ve finally cleared up some problems . __eou__
 I am happy that we ’ Ve finally cleared up some problems . __eou__  I think we have . Is there anything else to discuss ? __eou__
 No . That's all , I guess . __eou__  Then let's call it a day , shall we ? __eou__
 Silly me . __eou__  Now press this button . __eou__
 Glad to meet you , Mr . White . __eou__  Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ? __eou__
 Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress . __eou__  For how long ? __eou__
 3 years . __eou__  Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ? __eou__
 That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers . __eou__  You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent . __eou__
 I think I will give you a 3 months ’ trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed . __eou__  When am I supposed to start working ? __eou__
 Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . __eou__  But they can see my resume . It's all in there . __eou__
 But they can see my resume . It's all in there . __eou__  I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this . __eou__
 I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this . __eou__  Ok . What else ? __eou__
 They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? __eou__  I see . What about the salary ? __eou__
 Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . __eou__  Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot . __eou__
 Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot . __eou__  Anytime . Let me know how it works out . __eou__
 Our employees receive 15 days of paid vacation every year . If you don't use the full 15 days , they carry over to the following year . __eou__  How about sick days ? __eou__

 Two boxes of transparencies for the over-head machines . __eou__  Right . And I ’ d like one of those new electric pencil sharpeners . __eou__
 That ’ s true . But even beyond that , there ’ s the question of meeting the deadlines they ’ Ve set . __eou__  Right . Look , why don ’ t we make a list of the problems we ’ re dealing with . It ’ ll be easier to work through them that way . __eou__
 Not until next week , I think , the 15th . __eou__  Then , we ’ Ve got plenty of time . __eou__

Jason . There ’ s a snag in the plans for the Hoover Center . __eou__  What ’ s wrong ? I thought everything was set . __eou__

 Thank you . I ’ Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments . __eou__  You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? __eou__
 To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on __eou__  interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ? __eou__
 That depends a bit on the problem at hand . There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail __eou__  Sounds good . Everyone is taking about teams these days . Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ? __eou__
 I see myself as an encourager . Of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . In my last job , each representative handled __eou__  So , your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper . __eou__
Thank you for agreeing to come in and meet with us today . __eou__  Thank you for inviting me . __eou__
 Thank you for inviting me . __eou__  I can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for Corporate World Unlimited from 1997 to 1999 . Can you please tell me about your responsibilities ? __eou__
 Yes . I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada . As a manager , I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period . __eou__  What , do you believe , are some of the key attributes that helped you to achieve such an outstanding increase in sales ? __eou__
 But I ’ Ve never been on a business trip before ! __eou__  It ’ s easy enough . Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses . __eou__
 During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in __eou__  That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients . __eou__
 Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design __eou__  I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? __eou__
 Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t __eou__  That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? __eou__
 Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . __eou__  I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . __eou__
 I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . __eou__  Yes , I took a break from work during that time . I had a baby , and as she was born with a handicap , I decided to suspend my career . But I have continued to keep up with the Industry through con __eou__
 Yes , I took a break from work during that time . I had a baby , and as she was born with a handicap , I decided to suspend my career . But I have continued to keep up with the Industry through con __eou__  So , you ’ re just starting back . Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience . __eou__
 Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn ’ t been out of my possession . __eou__  Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ? __eou__
 No . __eou__  Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ? __eou__
 It ’ s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it . __eou__  What are these red things sir ? __eou__
 Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily . __eou__  I ’ m sorry sir , but you can ’ t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ’ t ’ be nervous ; we ’ ll just look through it briefly and then __eou__
 I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately 10 years . __eou__  Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills . __eou__
 I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system __eou__  Where do you see yourself five years from now ? __eou__
Good evening , sir . Welcome to the Comfort Inn . __eou__  Hello . I have a reservation , under the name Lee , Leo Lee . __eou__
 Hello . I have a reservation , under the name Lee , Leo Lee . __eou__  Mmmm . I ’ m not sure if we have you down here . How do you spell your last name ? __eou__
 It ’ s L-e-e . __eou__  Oh , right . You ’ re in our system . I was just looking under Li . So , we ’ Ve got you down for a Business Suite for three days . If I could just have your credit card , I ’ ll process your check-in while __eou__
 Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . __eou__  From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . __eou__
 From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . __eou__  I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? __eou__
 I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? __eou__  Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , __eou__
 Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , __eou__  So who has to stay behind ? __eou__
 Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . __eou__  Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket ! __eou__
 Definitely ! Very relaxing . __eou__  Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__
 That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__  But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . __eou__
 But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . __eou__  Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . __eou__
 Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . __eou__  But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . __eou__  Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? __eou__
 That ’ s the mini-bar . Each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . The items you consume are put on your bill . __eou__  I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! __eou__
 That's all , thank you . __eou__  What else do you want ? __eou__
Accounting , this is Mike . __eou__  Mike , this is Leo in Sales . I was just calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow.Are we still on ? __eou__
 Goodness ! It ’ s been so long I actually forgot . Let me see ... yes , it is on my calendar . __eou__  OK . See you at your office at 2:30 . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mr . Dome ’ s office . __eou__  This is Denise , Mr . Bruce ’ s Secretary . I was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with Mr . Dome at 4 o ’ clock . __eou__
 Yes , that ’ s correct . __eou__  Ok . Thank you . __eou__
Hi Ron , this is Kim at headquarters . __eou__  Oh , hi Kim . How ’ s it going ? __eou__
 Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag . __eou__  Ok . Mr . Lee , you ’ re all set . Your flight leaves from gate 10 . Boarding begins at 10:30 __eou__
 Let me check the computer . Uh-oh , Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris . __eou__  You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ? __eou__
 You can reach me at 13661306917 . __eou__  Thank you . I am terribly sorry about this . It very rarely happens . We do have a sophisticated tracking system , so I know we will find it soon . But we apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__
 That ’ s ok . There wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . The shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage . __eou__  Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully . __eou__
 Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully . __eou__  I ’ Ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it ’ s really no big deal . __eou__
 Are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ? __eou__  Yes I know , but I just got the chance to leave and so I am going to take it no matter what . __eou__
 Yes I know , but I just got the chance to leave and so I am going to take it no matter what . __eou__  I understand . So that ’ s one ticket to New York , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . Will that be one-way or round trip ? __eou__
 No , all flights are direct . __eou__  Perfect ! I ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ? __eou__
 It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . __eou__  Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat . __eou__
 I see that you have some impressive writing experience . __eou__  Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I ’ m also in the process of writing my first novel . __eou__
 Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I ’ m also in the process of writing my first novel . __eou__  Wonderful . I ’ d like to know why you ’ re interested in this position at our paper . __eou__
 That ’ s the one . It seems that everyone is anxious to get to New York tonight . __eou__  This is a rotten way to start a vacation . I HATE lines ! Can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__
 I don ’ t think he ’ s back today . __eou__  Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! __eou__
 She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . __eou__  What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__
 When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__  you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__
 I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__  On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . __eou__
 On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . __eou__  That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__
 That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__  Don't worry , we'll find someone eventually ! __eou__
 yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . __eou__  even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? __eou__
 that ’ s correct . __eou__  that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . __eou__
 that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . __eou__  well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . __eou__
 well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . __eou__  I see . I guess that makes sense . __eou__
 I see . I guess that makes sense . __eou__  do you have any other questions ? __eou__
 men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . __eou__  why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ? __eou__
 I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ? __eou__  yes , please . __eou__
 oh , no . not at all . __eou__  are you planning on studying abroad ? __eou__
 no , sir . __eou__  have you been given a better offer ? __eou__
 Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work . __eou__  well , what's the problem then ? __eou__
 it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that , but you don't need to quit over that . Why don't you just take a leave of absence ? We can hold your job for you until your mother gets better . __eou__
 sure , we'd be carry to lose a good worker like you . __eou__  thanks , sir . __eou__
 it was really busy . I had to work straight through my lunch break . __eou__  did you get to leave early then ? __eou__
 it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that . __eou__  let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ? __eou__
 it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . __eou__  you look pretty upset . Are you ok ? __eou__
 I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . __eou__  what ’ s that ? __eou__
 I got sacked today . __eou__  you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? __eou__
 well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week . __eou__  how late were you ? __eou__
 only about 5 minutes . __eou__  you got fired for being a few minutes late ? __eou__
 my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time . __eou__  oh well . You never really liked your boss anyway , did you ? __eou__
 Nope . __eou__  Have you updated your CV ? __eou__
 well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . __eou__  really ? Why ? __eou__
 it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . __eou__  but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! __eou__
 but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! __eou__  well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . __eou__
 well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . __eou__  well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? __eou__
 the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . __eou__  it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity . __eou__
 it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity . __eou__  I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more . __eou__
 I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more . __eou__  I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? __eou__
 it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit . __eou__  that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager . __eou__
 that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager . __eou__  thanks a lot . __eou__
 thanks a lot . __eou__  how's your assistant manager getting on ? __eou__
 well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass . __eou__  what seems to be the problem ? __eou__
 well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing . __eou__  if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ? __eou__
 to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . __eou__  I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management . __eou__
 I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management . __eou__  I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people . __eou__
 good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . __eou__  good morning . __eou__
 good morning . __eou__  the reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . __eou__
 oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . __eou__  she's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . __eou__
 she's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . __eou__  is there someone else I can talk to ? __eou__
 any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . __eou__  Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? __eou__
 I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business . __eou__  really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ? __eou__
 I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs . __eou__  how ’ s it going ? __eou__
 it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming ! __eou__  that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ? __eou__
 that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ? __eou__  our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . __eou__
 our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . __eou__  where will those be located ? __eou__
 if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October . __eou__  when will you find out ? __eou__
 we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow . __eou__  well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow ! __eou__
 well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow ! __eou__  thanks ! __eou__
 really well , thanks . __eou__  how are you finding your new boss ? __eou__
 she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . __eou__  would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__
 she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__  how about your new co-workers ? __eou__
 they are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . __eou__  do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__
 of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . __eou__  do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__
 sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__  do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__
 yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__  do you like working in teams ? __eou__
 I don't know . I only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__  I see . Have you found anything that you're interested in ? __eou__
 I've only found a few openings in my field . __eou__  what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__
 I'm trying to find a job in sound engineering . __eou__  there's not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ? __eou__
 unfortunately not . If I can't find anything in the field , then I could also work in the tourism field . __eou__  that's a good idea . You have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ? __eou__
 yes . __eou__  by the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . __eou__
 by the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . __eou__  really ? what is it ? __eou__
 it's a job at a recruitment agency . __eou__  that's interesting . Do you think they'd hire me ? __eou__
 well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . I think you'd be the perfect person for the job ! __eou__  that's true . I might as well call them up and see if I can get an interview . Do you have the details ? __eou__
I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! __eou__  don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . __eou__
 it was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , ONC small mistake can cost the company millions . __eou__  but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . __eou__
 that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about tha __eou__  let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? __eou__
 I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . __eou__  well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . __eou__
 that ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . __eou__  if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . __eou__
 I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__  Late night ? __eou__
 Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . __eou__  Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . __eou__
 I'm in between jobs at the moment . __eou__  what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__
 I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . __eou__  have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? __eou__
 no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? __eou__  not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? __eou__
 yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . __eou__  do you have experience in the IT field ? __eou__
 I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . __eou__  do you speak Spanish ? __eou__
 yes , but not fluently . __eou__  that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? __eou__
 I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . __eou__  did you write a clear objective in your resume ? __eou__
 no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . __eou__  I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . __eou__
 everything has been fine for the past several months . __eou__  great ! __eou__
 great ! __eou__  well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners __eou__
 well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners __eou__  sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? __eou__
 as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . __eou__  absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . __eou__
 absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . __eou__  for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . __eou__
 for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . __eou__  yes . this must be a huge difference . __eou__
 yes . this must be a huge difference . __eou__  can you think of anything else ? __eou__
 sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . __eou__  I didn't know that before . __eou__
 I didn't know that before . __eou__  and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . __eou__
 and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . __eou__  i got it . i'll bear it in mind . __eou__
 i got it . i'll bear it in mind . __eou__  don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . __eou__
 don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . __eou__  I hope so . __eou__
 I only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__  have you finished compiling your resume ? __eou__
 yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? __eou__  that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . __eou__
I just received a phone call for an interview next week . __eou__  Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever . __eou__
 Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever . __eou__  thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? __eou__
 I would try to land a job in Beijing . I just want to go to one of the big cities . __eou__  why ? __eou__
 many say more development opportunities can be found there . __eou__  that's true . Beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country . __eou__
 that's true . Beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country . __eou__  and there're higher salaries there . __eou__
 and there're higher salaries there . __eou__  well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . __eou__
 well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . __eou__  I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . __eou__
 I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . __eou__  one person ? How about your girlfriend ? __eou__
 oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . __eou__  sorry to hear that . It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home . __eou__
 sorry to hear that . It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home . __eou__  sure have . I want to offer my parents a better life ; so , I'll have to work very hard . __eou__
 sure have . I want to offer my parents a better life ; so , I'll have to work very hard . __eou__  I admire you . Good luck ! __eou__
 I want to tell you I've put in my notice . __eou__  really ? Why ? __eou__
 I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . __eou__  and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? __eou__
 yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received __eou__  absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . __eou__
 absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . __eou__  that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . __eou__
 that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . __eou__  this way , you'll earn more at the new work place . __eou__
 this way , you'll earn more at the new work place . __eou__  that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry . __eou__
 that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry . __eou__  that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead __eou__
 I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . __eou__  What kind of things did you need to check ? __eou__
 The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the __eou__  I see . Did anything else happen ? __eou__
 I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required __eou__  It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . __eou__
 It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . __eou__  Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client . __eou__
 Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client . __eou__  I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? __eou__
 Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__  You certainly had a busy day . __eou__
 You certainly had a busy day . __eou__  That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . __eou__
How time flies ! We have been in Beijing for almost 4 years . __eou__  yes , I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . __eou__
 yes , I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . __eou__  yeah , feels like yesterday . Now I ’ m almost settled down here . We ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot . __eou__
 yeah , feels like yesterday . Now I ’ m almost settled down here . We ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot . __eou__  congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing . __eou__
 congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing . __eou__  thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ? __eou__
 no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . __eou__  why is that ? __eou__
 well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . __eou__  yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle . __eou__
 yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle . __eou__  that ’ s right . I work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here . __eou__
 that ’ s right . I work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here . __eou__  I understand your position . Perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . You ’ ll feel much better with your family around . __eou__
 I understand your position . Perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . You ’ ll feel much better with your family around . __eou__  yeah , I think so . __eou__
Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . __eou__  Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . __eou__
 Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . __eou__  Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__
 Yes , of course . That's quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance al __eou__  I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? __eou__
 Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . __eou__  Excellent.Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ? __eou__
 The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . __eou__  I hope to hear from you very soon . __eou__
 Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . __eou__  I see . And how about the working hours ? __eou__
 Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . __eou__  Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . __eou__
 Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . __eou__  Good , as long as you understand that . __eou__
 Good , as long as you understand that . __eou__  And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? __eou__
 Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . __eou__  So , what changed ? __eou__
 Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . __eou__  Wow , a real step up ! __eou__
 Wow , a real step up ! __eou__  Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__
 Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__  I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__
 Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so . __eou__  So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__
 Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . __eou__  Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__
 Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . __eou__  Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? __eou__
 Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . __eou__  What would you say is your most positive quality ? __eou__
 Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . __eou__  Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . __eou__
 Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . __eou__  Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . __eou__
 Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . __eou__  Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? __eou__
 Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . __eou__  What did that involve ? __eou__
 Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . __eou__  I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? __eou__
Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... __eou__  For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g __eou__
 For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g __eou__  Certainly . And after your internship ? __eou__
 They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really __eou__  Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 right . __eou__
 Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 right . __eou__  Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . __eou__
 Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . __eou__  The London Weekly right . __eou__
 The London Weekly right . __eou__  Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . __eou__
 from next week on , we should be in less of a rush . __eou__  I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it . __eou__
 that ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . __eou__  carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work . __eou__
 carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work . __eou__  good . I have to go right now . I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . __eou__
 good . I have to go right now . I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . __eou__  they usually go on for ages . __eou__
 they usually go on for ages . __eou__  I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . __eou__
 hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted . __eou__  I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions . __eou__
 I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions . __eou__  so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people . __eou__
 so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people . __eou__  so what happened in the meeting ? __eou__
 one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting . __eou__  I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections . __eou__
 Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__  So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__
 No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . __eou__  How can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__
 You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . __eou__  What else do you suggest ? __eou__
 Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . __eou__  What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? __eou__
 I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . __eou__  Do you get paid onetime ? __eou__
 No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . __eou__  Do you have any breaks ? __eou__
 We have an hour-long lunch break form 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . __eou__  My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__
 There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__  Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . __eou__
 Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . __eou__  I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . __eou__
 First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__  That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . __eou__
 Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . __eou__  When will the branch office open ? __eou__
 Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . __eou__  Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? __eou__
 Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines . __eou__  I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers . __eou__
 I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork . __eou__  Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently . __eou__
 Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently . __eou__  That ’ s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ? __eou__
I ’ m afraid we are really short staffed this week , Mr . Cranial . I ’ d like to accommodate you , but I just don ’ t think I ’ ll have the time . __eou__  Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? __eou__
 What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week . __eou__  I know , but I want to make reservations this week . __eou__
 Yes , I pretty much understand the company . __eou__  Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ? __eou__
 Yes , I've been observing them . __eou__  When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ? __eou__
 I already have something to wear . __eou__  I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ? __eou__
I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview . __eou__  Make sure that you understand the company . Do you understand what it is that they do ? __eou__
 No , I probably need to do some more research . __eou__  When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed . Does that make sense ? __eou__
 I think that their attitude is rather casual . __eou__  So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear . Do you have something to wear ? __eou__
 I have absolutely nothing so far . __eou__  You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ? __eou__
 Yeah , hold on a second . I ’ Ve got it in my office . Here it is . 553-2213 . __eou__  553-2213 . Great , thanks . __eou__
 553-2213 . Great , thanks . __eou__  No problem . Pick me up something to eat too , please . __eou__
Thank you so much for interviewing me this evening . __eou__  Happy to meet with you . Now , do you prefer group projects ? __eou__
 I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group . __eou__  Do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead ? __eou__
 I want to grow in my job and move ahead . __eou__  Could you work for us in another state , if need be ? __eou__
 75,000 per year . __eou__  Yikes ! Thanks for your interest in this job . We ’ ll be getting back to you . __eou__
 Yes , I know how to get there on my own . __eou__  Great ! We will send you all the details later . Looking forward to meeting with you ! __eou__
 I was in my friend's room , talking for an hour or so . __eou__  And then ? __eou__
 I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone . __eou__  I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ? __eou__
 Yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card . __eou__  I'll make a report for you and please claim this to the insurance company with this report . __eou__
Hello . Excuse me . __eou__  Yes . Can I help you ? __eou__
 Of course I remember you . __eou__  I think I lost my wallet here . __eou__
 I think I lost my wallet here . __eou__  Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . __eou__
 No . It's been empty the whole time . __eou__  Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . __eou__
 Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . __eou__  I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? __eou__
 No . My friend did . __eou__  Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? __eou__
 No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . __eou__  Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . __eou__
 Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . __eou__  I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? __eou__
 You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . __eou__  Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . __eou__
 Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . __eou__  I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . __eou__
 I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . __eou__  Thanks for your help . __eou__
 No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . __eou__  It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . __eou__
 It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . __eou__  I locked it when I left though . __eou__
 I locked it when I left though . __eou__  Yes , but the robber broke in.Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked . __eou__
 Yes , but the robber broke in.Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked . __eou__  I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! __eou__
 The TV's still here . __eou__  And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs . __eou__
There's someone coming . __eou__  It took them four minutes to get here . That was pretty fast . __eou__
 It took them four minutes to get here . That was pretty fast . __eou__  Yes , it's fast . But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage . __eou__
 Yes , it's fast . But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage . __eou__  I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning . __eou__
 I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning . __eou__  I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this . Do you know them well ? __eou__
 Not really . __eou__  Do you know where they're vacationing ? __eou__
 I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . __eou__  Yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . Don't you think ? __eou__
 It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting . __eou__  Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__
 They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . __eou__  Why do they go there ? __eou__
 Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__  When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__
 When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__  That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__
 That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__  I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__
 I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__  That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__
 That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__  Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__
 Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__  Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__
 Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__  Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__
 I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__  Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__
 Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded . __eou__  How did this war start ? __eou__
 Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other . __eou__  Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise . __eou__
 Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise . __eou__  Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down . __eou__
 Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down . __eou__  What do you think will happen ? __eou__
 Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate . __eou__  It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first . __eou__
 I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__  It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__
 It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__  several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__
 several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__  How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__
 I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro __eou__  So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__
 So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__  It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__
 It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__  Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__
 Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__  The problem is that many poor people might suffer . __eou__
 Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! __eou__  Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry ? __eou__
 It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . __eou__  I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans . __eou__
 I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans . __eou__  That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! __eou__

This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom . __eou__

 Yes . __eou__  Ok , sign here . __eou__
 Just about half an hour ago . __eou__  Tell me where it happened and how . __eou__
 Yes , it was just when I was walking in the park . I saw some children with a newspaper . __eou__  That happens often these days . Well , please fill in this Report of Theft . __eou__
 I remember I saw when I was dining in the Aidan Restaurant . When I paid the bill , I saw it in my handbag . __eou__  Could you please tell me your passport number ? __eou__

 Yes , I'd like to report a case . Somebody broke into my house . __eou__  When did that happen ? __eou__
 It happened in the morning . I just came home from work and found the lock broken . __eou__  Is anything lost ? __eou__
 I don't know . I called the police as soon as I found the lock broken . __eou__  OK , we will send some men as soon as possible . __eou__
 My name is Benjamin , and I live in Broad-Gate Street 2101 . __eou__  OK , got it . Please don't worry sir . We will be there soon . __eou__

And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! __eou__  Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom . __eou__
 She has blond hair and blue eyes . __eou__  What was she wearing ? __eou__
 She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers . __eou__  When did you last see her ? __eou__
 I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . I don ’ t know ... __eou__  How long has it been ? __eou__
 We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . __eou__  Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? __eou__
 Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members . __eou__  What ’ s a cabinet ? __eou__
 This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . __eou__  Can any mp make a law ? __eou__
 Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . __eou__  I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . __eou__
 I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . __eou__  Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . __eou__
 Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . __eou__  How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? __eou__
 Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag . __eou__  Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ? __eou__
 No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about . __eou__  You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . __eou__
 No . I couldn ’ t find a policeman . __eou__  Well . You must report that it ’ s been stolen . And give the police description of your bag . You ’ d better go to the local police station tomorrow morning . __eou__
 And Lisa . __eou__  Yes ? __eou__
 Somebody broke into my house in the morning . __eou__  When did you find out ? __eou__
 About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work . __eou__  Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces . __eou__
 Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces . __eou__  I wonder how the burglar did it . __eou__
 He is so unskillful . I have never seen such an awkward burglar . __eou__  That's because we have a strong lock . __eou__
 That's because we have a strong lock . __eou__  Probably . Let's check the inside then . __eou__
 Yes , the house was in a terrible mess . It was almost turned upside down by the burglar . __eou__  Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it . __eou__
 Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it . __eou__  You mean it is not created by the burglar ? __eou__
 The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . __eou__  But we need the exact time . What time ? __eou__
 Yes , I already have one . __eou__  OK , well after you take one out of that second drawer , you put your name on the top . Do you see ? __eou__
 I am kind of confused . __eou__  Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . Do you know how to show time on a 24 - hour clock ? __eou__
 I'm not quite sure . __eou__  Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ? __eou__
 Thanks for your help . __eou__  Try it and if you can't do it , one of us can always help you later . __eou__
 No , I don't know where to find one . __eou__  Well , once you get one off the shelf over there , you first put your name on it . OK ? __eou__
 No , I don't know what that is . __eou__  OK , so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it . Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes . OK ? __eou__
 Yes , I have seen them . __eou__  Yes , well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website . OK ? __eou__
 I thought you said this was easy . __eou__  You are a quick learner . I don't think you'll have any trouble with this . __eou__
 I am trying to call my boss . __eou__  For an outside call you now just dial the number . For a company number you need to know the extension . Do you have a list of extensions ? __eou__
 I know a few extensions but I don't know them all . __eou__  You can always look an extension up on the company website . __eou__
 No , I don't hear anything . __eou__  Next you dial 9 on the keypad . You should hear the tone change . Did you hear it change ? __eou__
 I'm not sure . __eou__  OK . Well , after you get the line to change you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? __eou__
 I am trying to call a client . __eou__  To call a number on the outside you now just dial the number . For inside calls , punch in the extension number . Has someone given you an extension list ? __eou__
 No , I don't know anyone's extension . __eou__  All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help . __eou__
 Yes , I hear the tone . __eou__  OK . Now you dial 9 on the keypad . Do you hear the tone change ? __eou__
 Yes , it changed . __eou__  Well , when you hear it change , that means you have an outside line . Where are you trying to call ? __eou__
 I am trying to call home . __eou__  OK . Well , to dial to the outside you just now dial the number . For a call inside the company just hit the extension number . Do you know the extensions ? __eou__
 Yes , I have a list of extensions . __eou__  Well , if you ever need help with an extension , you can dial O . __eou__
I am sorry I am so late to work . __eou__  What was the problem ? __eou__
 I lost track of time . __eou__  Things happen ; make sure it doesn't become a habit . __eou__
 Yes , I understand the numbers . __eou__  I will explain it again ; especially for those of you who arrived late . __eou__
 My friend needed me to help him . __eou__  I realize that everyone has emergencies ; just get here on time from now on . __eou__
 I am confused about the projected revenues . __eou__  I'm glad that some of you get it , but let's go over it once more . __eou__

 No , I don't think so . __eou__  Glasses ? __eou__
 No . __eou__  what about his hair ? __eou__
 Black or dark brown . __eou__  Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? __eou__
 Straight , I think , and about average length . __eou__  Boy , this surely doesn't help us much.It could be anybody.How about his cloth ? What was he wearing . __eou__
 Well , he had a Jacked or a Plage shirt . You know the kind of number jack wear . __eou__  Ok , now we are getting some where.Pants ? __eou__
 Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure . __eou__  What kind of shoes ? __eou__
 Boots __eou__  Cow while Boots . __eou__
 Cow while Boots . __eou__  No , hiking boots . Brown ones . __eou__
 No , hiking boots . Brown ones . __eou__  All right . That nearly done a little.Now I want you to look some pictures . __eou__
 We've found some heroin at your house . __eou__  No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . __eou__
 No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . __eou__  That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . __eou__
 I don't need your help , jerk . __eou__  Whatever you say . __eou__
 My name is James . __eou__  What's your nationality ? __eou__
 American . __eou__  What's your relationship with the victim ? __eou__
 I don't know him . __eou__  Why did you attack the victim ? __eou__
 Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away . __eou__  How many times did you stab the victim ? __eou__
 I stabbed his belly three times . __eou__  Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ? __eou__
 I knew , but I couldn't myself . __eou__  Was it your intention to kill the victim ? __eou__
 Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can . __eou__  Did you see the car before it hit you ? __eou__
 No , I didn't . That car was too fast . __eou__  Which lane were you in ? __eou__
 I don't remember . __eou__  What was your speed then ? __eou__

 No , I didn't get hurt . Thanks for your concern . __eou__  No problem , Miss . __eou__
 It's hard to say ! But it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__  Yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__
 Yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__  How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__
 I don't think that there is any easy way . __eou__  I think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support . __eou__
 I think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support . __eou__  Yeah , you are right ! __eou__
 I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . __eou__  So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__
 So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__  It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . __eou__

 I don't understand the projected revenues . __eou__  Let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand . __eou__
There is a very critical debate between the presidential candidates tonight . __eou__  Do you know which channel it is on ? __eou__
 Five I think . All three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms . __eou__  I used to be really interested in that . But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway . So why listen ? __eou__
 We have to . If nobody listened that would be like turning our backs on our own rights and obligations to the freedoms that our forefathers fought for . __eou__  It's not that serious . __eou__
 It's not that serious . __eou__  Yes it is . Think about it . If nobody paid any attention to anything then what's it all for anyway ? __eou__
 I had no idea when I volunteered to assist governor Brown with this campaign what I was getting myself into . __eou__  Hang in there . The hardest part is just about over . __eou__

 Basically , you really don ’ t need to do much of anything . On the Continued Claim Form , you will note that you now have a new job and also note what you are earning . __eou__  If I get work for a few weeks , will I be terminated from EDD ? __eou__
 Well , I got laid off , and I ’ m looking for work . __eou__  Yeah , me too ! What are you thinking you would like to do ? __eou__
 Right now , I ’ ll take about anything that will pay the mortgage . __eou__  Have you gone out on any interviews so far ? __eou__
 I went out on one interview , but I haven ’ t heard back from them . __eou__  Did you see the posting for the electrician apprentice program ? __eou__
 You know , I saw that and it looks pretty good ! __eou__  Let ’ s go check it out again ! __eou__
 A Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter will be sent to you . __eou__  What information will be in that letter ? __eou__
 The Award Letter will inform you as to how much you will receive . __eou__  What other forms will I need to turn in ? __eou__
 Every two weeks you will receive a Continued Claim Form that you must turn in . __eou__  What will they be asking me on that form ? __eou__
 You must show that you were available and that you looked for work . __eou__  What else will they ask me ? __eou__
 The Employment Development Office will send you a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter . __eou__  What is contained in that letter ? __eou__
 In addition to telling you how much you will receive , the beginning and ending dates of your claim will be included . __eou__  Will the Award Letter tell me what I need to fill out next ? __eou__
 You will receive a Continued Claim Form and every two weeks , you must turn it in . __eou__  When I fill out the Continued Claim Form , what will I need to tell them ? __eou__
 I think I forgot to send it in ! __eou__  You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid . __eou__
 Yes , actually , I did make a little bit of money . __eou__  Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ? __eou__
 Yes , I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form . __eou__  Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check . __eou__
 Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check . __eou__  Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then . __eou__
 Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then . __eou__  That is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment . __eou__
 I hope that you remembered to send in your last Continued Claim Form . __eou__  I am pretty sure that I didn ’ t send that claim form in . __eou__
 I am pretty sure that I didn ’ t send that claim form in . __eou__  You have to send that form in every two weeks so we that we will know what to pay you . __eou__
 You can ’ t mail it in early because you don ’ t know , in advance , how much you will be working . __eou__  Even though I was late turning in my form , will my paycheck be late ? __eou__
 My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week . __eou__  What about income ? Did you make any money during that period ? __eou__
 My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period . __eou__  When you filled out your Continued Claim Form , did you show that income ? __eou__
 Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form . __eou__  What happens is , when you make money , we take part of your benefits away . __eou__
 I am not going to show any income from now on then . __eou__  I wouldn ’ t do that if I were you . There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements . __eou__
 I made a little bit of money , but not much . __eou__  Did that income show up on your last Continued Claim Form ? __eou__
 I claimed the work I did on the last Continued Claim Form . __eou__  When you are able to find work and get paid , we always take away part of your check . __eou__
 When you are able to find work and get paid , we always take away part of your check . __eou__  That being the case , I don ’ t think that I am going to show the income next time . __eou__
 That being the case , I don ’ t think that I am going to show the income next time . __eou__  Don ’ t do it ! If you get caught making false statements , you can have your claim closed . __eou__
Well , Mr . Brooks . I ’ m sorry , again , for the delay , but we should have everything completed by the time you get back . __eou__  I certainly hope so . Can we arrange to meet on the 27th ? That should give you enough time . __eou__
 I am afraid that I forgot to send it in . __eou__  We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks . __eou__
 It can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it . __eou__  I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem . __eou__
 You can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it ! __eou__  Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ? __eou__
 Yes , ma ’ am . I could come in any day next week , except for Friday morning . __eou__  Fine . Let me take a look at his schedule . He ’ s free on Tuesday afternoon at 1:30 . Could you come in then ? __eou__
I definitely want to meet with you , Mr . Parker . I just need to sort out my schedule . __eou__  Well , I know you ’ re pretty booked up these days . But , we ’ Ve got to work fast on this . __eou__
 Sure . Let me just grab my calendar . All right . I ’ m free all day Tuesday and Thursday morning . __eou__  Tuesday morning is good for me . How about 10:30 in my office ? __eou__
Tom , this is Mary Bobbins . She ’ s just come over from sales . __eou__  It ’ s nice to meet you ! Guess we ’ ll be working together . __eou__
 It ’ s nice to meet you ! Guess we ’ ll be working together . __eou__  Yes , she ’ ll be working closely with you on the marketing end of things . __eou__
 Yes , she ’ ll be working closely with you on the marketing end of things . __eou__  Good . Well , welcome aboard , Ms , Robbins . __eou__
morning , Mr . Montgomery . I ’ Ve been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams . __eou__  Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ? __eou__
 Oh , about seven years . Time flies , you know ! __eou__  Does it ever ! Well , let ’ s get started . If you could begin typing this letter now , I ’ ll see what else needs to be done . __eou__
 It ’ s nice to meet you , too , Ms . Green . This company seems so big right now ; I don ’ t know how I ’ ll ever get used to it . __eou__  After a week , you ’ ll be running around here like a pro . Let me give you this list of departments first , next to each department is its location and the name of the manager . __eou__
Well , I ’ m glad I had a chance to see these samples , but I ’ m really not in a position to make a decision right now . __eou__  Would you like me to leave the samples with you ? __eou__
Rich ! I ’ m glad I caught you . Mr . Carlton ’ s just come over here from the main office . __eou__  Yeah ? What does he want ? __eou__
Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . __eou__  Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . __eou__
 Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . __eou__  No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . __eou__
 No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . __eou__  Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way . __eou__
 I got a ticket , and I would like to fight it . __eou__  Is the officer that pulled you over here today ? __eou__
 He's here . __eou__  Tell me what happened . __eou__
 The officer says that I ran a red light , but I didn't . __eou__  The officer wouldn't lie about that . __eou__
 The officer wouldn't lie about that . __eou__  He must've , because the signal had a camera on top of it . __eou__
 He must've , because the signal had a camera on top of it . __eou__  There was no picture taken of your license plate ? __eou__
 I don't believe it took my picture . __eou__  I'm just going to let you go . __eou__
 I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . __eou__  what happened to him ? __eou__
 he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . __eou__  was it his first offence ? __eou__
 unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . __eou__  what happened to him then ? __eou__
 not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . __eou__  did they take his license away ? __eou__
 no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . __eou__  what do you think will happen to him ? __eou__
 well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . __eou__  that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? __eou__
 not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . __eou__  my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . __eou__
 my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . __eou__  that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . __eou__
 You mean , what's happening ? Well , constable , I'm trying to get out of the windowand Fred here is helping me . __eou__  Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door ? __eou__
 No , it's my brother's . I'm staying with him for a while . __eou__  Is he at home ? __eou__
 I believe it happened last night . __eou__  Where was the break-in ? __eou__
 It happened at my house . __eou__  Was anything stolen ? __eou__
 I haven't checked yet . __eou__  Why do you think there was a break-in ? __eou__
 My front window was broken . __eou__  We'll send a squad car shortly . __eou__
 I watched it happen . __eou__  Really ? __eou__
 Yes . I was right there . __eou__  What did you see ? __eou__
 This guy tried to rob the bank . __eou__  I can't believe it . __eou__
 I can't believe it . __eou__  I was really scared when he pulled the gun out . __eou__
 I was really scared when he pulled the gun out . __eou__  What happened next ? __eou__
 He tried to leave with the money . __eou__  Did he get caught ? __eou__
 I ’ m going on trial . __eou__  What is your trial about ? __eou__
 It ’ s a felony charge . __eou__  I ’ d be glad to help . __eou__
 Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign . __eou__  I am very impressed . __eou__
 I am very impressed . __eou__  I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it . __eou__
 I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it . __eou__  That is very nice of you . __eou__
 That is very nice of you . __eou__  Will you be voting ? __eou__
 Yes , I am going to vote . __eou__  Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day . __eou__
 I am volunteering for the campaign . __eou__  What made you decide to volunteer ? __eou__
 I want to be a part of history . __eou__  Good for you . __eou__
 Good for you . __eou__  Do you plan on voting ? __eou__
 I will be voting . __eou__  You should try and make it early to your polling place . __eou__
 I ’ Ve already voted . __eou__  How ’ s that ? __eou__
 I sent in an absentee ballot . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 I won ’ t be able to vote on Tuesday . __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 I have to work . __eou__  Why don ’ t you go to work late ? __eou__
 I have important business to take care of that morning . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 I ’ m working here today . __eou__  That ’ s wonderful . Thank you . __eou__
 I have your ballot card right here . __eou__  What am I supposed to do now ? __eou__
 You can choose a short-term or yearly rental . __eou__  I'll have to ask my wife how long she'll need it for as it is mainly for her belongings . I'll come back after we have discussed it . Thanks for your help . __eou__
 No problem . My husband bought me some beautiful jewellery for our anniversary and I don't feel safe keeping it in the house . Initially , on the advice of a friend , I stored it in the freezer . __eou__  What a lovely gift . Yes , I can understand why you wouldn't be comfortable keeping something so valuable at home . I think one of our small ones will be perfect . Do you have some ID with you ? __eou__
 We have 3 different types of boxes . We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box . __eou__  I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time . __eou__
 You can have more than 1 key if you'd like , but we must have signature cards for each box . __eou__  That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help . __eou__
 That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help . __eou__  If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance , we can do that for you today , there is no need to wait . __eou__
First National Bank . __eou__  Hi , I have a checking account with you . __eou__
 Hi , I have a checking account with you . __eou__  How can I help you ? __eou__
 That's no problem . We have many different ways to go about getting a mortgage and all with terms to suit you . __eou__  You see , I've just got married and we are looking at getting on the property ladder with our first home . __eou__
 You see , I've just got married and we are looking at getting on the property ladder with our first home . __eou__  Well , congratulations ! It's lovely being a newly wed , but also so much pressure . Could you tell me what kind of property you are looking for ? __eou__
 Yes , just a simple apartment , nothing too big . __eou__  Yes , I see . There are just the two of you at the moment . Please take a look through this brochure ; it's especially for first-time-buyers . I think it'll be very helpful . __eou__
 It should all be sorted out within 5 working days after receipt of the required documents . __eou__  Right , I'll contact my guarantor now and we'll come in within the next couple of days . Thanks very much for your help . Goodbye . __eou__
 I hope so . I'm in the process of applying for a credit card with you , and Ms Wang asked me to drop off these documents . __eou__  Let me take a look ... ID , yes , form completed , yes , well , it looks in order , Sir . __eou__
 Let me take a look ... ID , yes , form completed , yes , well , it looks in order , Sir . __eou__  Do you need anything else from me ? __eou__
 The minimum deposit is 1,500 RIB . But you will need to pay some small additional handling charges as well . __eou__  I think I can manage that . Let's see ... yes , here we are . __eou__
 Say , 6 months ? Or less in fact . I want to repay the loan ASAP ; I don't like debt hanging over my head . __eou__  A wise decision . If you decide to take out a short-term loan with us , say for 6 months or less , the interest rate shall be for that of a 6 - month loan . __eou__
 A wise decision . If you decide to take out a short-term loan with us , say for 6 months or less , the interest rate shall be for that of a 6 - month loan . __eou__  What if I repay it early . Any perks ? __eou__
 Well , we could adjust the interest rate based on the original rate and the amount of days you actually borrowed the money for . __eou__  So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan . __eou__
 So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan . __eou__  It's our pleasure . We are always happy to have another satisfied customer . Thanks for calling . Goodbye . __eou__
 That might be a good idea , yes . __eou__  Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ? __eou__
 I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks . __eou__  Actually , I have a suggestion for you . We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this ? __eou__
 Not a problem . But may I just inform you that we have introduced a new service called Account Renewing upon Maturity ? __eou__  Yes ... __eou__
 Of course . As we provide many different services for all of our valued customers , we like to give than a special place to do their business with us . __eou__  I think of myself as a valued customer . What services can you offer me ? __eou__
 There are all kinds of deposit services and also the calculations of the interest . It's specific to different accounts and different circumstances . __eou__  Right . Is there anything else that can be done there ? __eou__
 There's information on deposit or loan rates , exchange rates ... __eou__  The list goes on and on ! __eou__
 The list goes on and on ! __eou__  Yes , it sure does . And with our new premises , we have new services . We can provide 24 - hour support for your Wealth Management . __eou__
 Yes , it sure does . And with our new premises , we have new services . We can provide 24 - hour support for your Wealth Management . __eou__  So , I can talk to my Personal Banker 24/7 . That's really thoughtful of you . And I have to say , I love the new look of the bank . __eou__
 Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have . __eou__  How's Mrs Zu doing these days ? __eou__
 She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see . __eou__  Can I give you some advice on a loan , or ... __eou__
 Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house . __eou__  Let me run through a couple of other options with you . That way , you can make a more informed decision . __eou__
 Exactly . Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . And , we provide a Professional Fund Manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us . __eou__  How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ? __eou__
 Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each . __eou__  Is this the information here ? Well , let's take a look then ... __eou__
 Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . __eou__  I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? __eou__
 I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? __eou__  Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu . __eou__
 Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already . __eou__  That's excellent . Well , for our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan we offer some really competitive rates . The maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years . __eou__
 That's excellent . Well , for our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan we offer some really competitive rates . The maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years . __eou__  I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ? __eou__
 Of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 % __eou__  So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ? __eou__
 We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . __eou__  That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time . __eou__
 My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . __eou__  That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . __eou__
 That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . __eou__  Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? __eou__
 What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . __eou__  Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? __eou__
 Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . __eou__  What do you require ? __eou__
 A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__  That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got . __eou__
 I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . __eou__  Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . __eou__
 No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . __eou__  But that is a little risky , you know . __eou__
 But that is a little risky , you know . __eou__  Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ? __eou__
 Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . __eou__  I can ask for some advice from him . __eou__
 Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . __eou__  The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... __eou__
 The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... __eou__  Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . __eou__
 Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . __eou__  That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? __eou__
 Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . __eou__  What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__
 When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead . __eou__  That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . __eou__
 That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . __eou__  As you can see from the statements for my Current Account , I have never been overdrawn . I'm always very careful about that . __eou__
 Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB . __eou__  Why such a big difference ? __eou__
 It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . __eou__  My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ? __eou__
 Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . __eou__  That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire . __eou__
 Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . __eou__  Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . __eou__
 Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . __eou__  You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . __eou__
 You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . __eou__  Really ? __eou__
 Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . __eou__  So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? __eou__
 Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . __eou__  How so ? __eou__
 For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops . __eou__  Oh , I see . Well , I don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that I can if I had to . Thanks for that . __eou__
 Right . Well , the benefits are a little different . With our Corporate Card you can use it for agency collection and payment . __eou__  Is there anything else ? __eou__
 There's quite a long list , actually ! You can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments . __eou__  And I suppose I can do that anywhere ? I do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts . __eou__
 If you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions . __eou__  In just one document ? That will definitely be a time saver . __eou__
 Yes , it is . But I'm afraid we haven't met before . __eou__  I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ? __eou__
 Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . __eou__  I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? __eou__
 That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean . __eou__  I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ? __eou__
 The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . __eou__  We do indeed . Such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . __eou__
 We do indeed . Such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . __eou__  That's good to know . Thanks for your help today , I'll leave you with the details and you can get started . __eou__
 Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . __eou__  We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry . __eou__
 We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry . __eou__  Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . __eou__
 10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country . __eou__  I'm not exactly prepared right now . How about I go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ? __eou__
 This scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks . __eou__  That does sound good . I'm already an account holder , have been for many years . And I already have your existing card . __eou__
 That does sound good . I'm already an account holder , have been for many years . And I already have your existing card . __eou__  That should make things perfectly simple , then . Actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post . __eou__
 That should make things perfectly simple , then . Actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post . __eou__  Perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! So , I can just upgrade automatically ? __eou__
 OK , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . That means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card . __eou__  Wonderful ! And , you mentioned ' perks ' ? I do hope I'll be getting some of those . __eou__
 I think so . __eou__  We will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company , the company address ... __eou__
 I hope so . I'm not actually a customer here , but I saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper about your new bank card . __eou__  I see . Yes , the advertisement has proven very effective . Would you like to apply for a card with us ? __eou__
 That's right . But don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure . __eou__  Could I open an account with you today ? __eou__
 Yes , please . That's being processed now . As soon as the account is set up , we can issue you with a card . __eou__  So quick and easy ! Thanks very much . __eou__
 No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card . __eou__  Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card . __eou__
 Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card . __eou__  Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days . __eou__
 Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days . __eou__  Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week . __eou__
 Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week . __eou__  Of course ! How silly of me ! Yes , 5 working days would mean this Friday , at the earliest . I see . I'm sorry to trouble you . __eou__
 Of course ! How silly of me ! Yes , 5 working days would mean this Friday , at the earliest . I see . I'm sorry to trouble you . __eou__  It's no trouble at all , Sir . Is there anything else I can help you with today ? __eou__
 What perfect timing ! __eou__  Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ? __eou__
 Unfortunately , an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money . That's what's causing the hold up . __eou__  Oh , I see . I thought maybe it was just the time of the day , although it isn't usually busy at 2:30 in the afternoon . __eou__
 Oh , I see . I thought maybe it was just the time of the day , although it isn't usually busy at 2:30 in the afternoon . __eou__  You are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . Could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ? __eou__
 800 RIB , please . __eou__  Please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . And sign here , please . __eou__
 This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle . __eou__  Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ . __eou__
 Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ . __eou__  That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week . __eou__
 That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week . __eou__  Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system . __eou__
 Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system . __eou__  Shall I come in and collect it ? __eou__
 I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it . __eou__  Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ? __eou__
 No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! __eou__  You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? __eou__
 Yes , it's the same every day during the lunchtime rush . We will be putting in a new ATM in the near future , though . That should help to ease the queues . __eou__  I'll look forward to that , I can't stand queuing . __eou__
 I'll look forward to that , I can't stand queuing . __eou__  I know what you mean . How much would you like to deposit with us today ? __eou__
 1,000 RIB , it should all be there . __eou__  That's correct , 1,000 RIB . I'll need your personal code to deposit this . Could you enter it on this key pad , please ? __eou__
 Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ? __eou__  Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! __eou__
 Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! __eou__  That's the opinion of most people . Do you have your passport with you ? I'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form . __eou__
 A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . __eou__  But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you . __eou__
 We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . __eou__  I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free . __eou__
 A specialist ? That's excellent , thanks . __eou__  No problem , Sir . He'll be with you in just a minute . Could I get you something to drink while you are waiting ? __eou__
 Yes , I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy . Unfortunately , I just don't have access to the cash . __eou__  I see . It's a problem most of us face . May I ask what the purchase price is ? __eou__
 It's 600,000 RIB . But I've already put down 200,000 RIB , which is my absolute limit , so I'm looking for a loan of 400,000 RIB . __eou__  So , you've already made a large initial deposit ? That is good news . OK , let's have a look at your credit details and get this started . __eou__
 I see . We offer Personal Housing Loans , or mortgages , at a rate of 0.42 % per month . __eou__  That's pretty much the same as I've been quoted at other banks . __eou__
 That's pretty much the same as I've been quoted at other banks . __eou__  We offer many different payment plans . Would you be looking at long-term or short-term ? Are you looking at a 10 - year repayment plan ? __eou__
 Definitely . I want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as I can . __eou__  Then we can certainly help you with that . You see , for shorter term loans , we can offer an even more competitive interest rate . __eou__
 This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . __eou__  So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? __eou__
 That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see . __eou__  That is good to know . Just think ! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease . Thank you . __eou__
 Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs . __eou__  That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . __eou__
 That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . __eou__  With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . __eou__
 With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . __eou__  That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself . __eou__
 That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself . __eou__  That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this . __eou__
 You do , I'm afraid . There are 3 ways to do this . You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . __eou__  Yes , I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . I'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please . __eou__
 Right , that's no problem . I see you are already well informed . If you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees . __eou__  OK , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . Thanks . __eou__
 I don ’ t know where to get my ballot . __eou__  I can help you with that . __eou__
 I can help you with that . __eou__  How can you help me ? __eou__
 I work here . __eou__  That ’ s great . __eou__

 All right , here is your ballot card . __eou__  What do I do now ? __eou__

 I didn ’ t know that . __eou__  Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll be fine . __eou__
 That ’ s good to know . __eou__  Congratulations on your first voting day . __eou__
 Yes , and for the first time . __eou__  Is that right ? __eou__
 I don ’ t know how to vote . __eou__  Voting isn ’ t difficult . __eou__
 Voting isn ’ t difficult . __eou__  I ’ m not sure what laws are being voted on . __eou__
 I ’ m not sure what laws are being voted on . __eou__  They tell you everything on the ballot . __eou__
 They tell you everything on the ballot . __eou__  They do ? __eou__
 This is going to be my first time voting . __eou__  Are you serious ? __eou__
 I ’ m not sure what I ’ m doing . __eou__  Voting is easy . __eou__
 I don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass . __eou__  The ballot gives you all that information . __eou__
 Nobody told me that before . __eou__  You have nothing to worry about . __eou__
I am really excited ! __eou__  Why are you so excited ? __eou__
 I just got done voting . __eou__  This was your first time voting , wasn ’ t it ? __eou__
 I just turned 18 last month . __eou__  That is so lucky of you . __eou__
 That is so lucky of you . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 You turned 18 a month before the election . __eou__  I didn ’ t think of it that way . __eou__
 I didn ’ t think of it that way . __eou__  Are you serious ? __eou__
 Seriously , but I ’ m excited that I did . __eou__  Congratulations on being a part of history . __eou__
 I sure did ! __eou__  What candidate did you vote for ? __eou__
 I voted for Obama . __eou__  I ’ m shocked he actually won . __eou__
 I ’ m shocked he actually won . __eou__  I knew he would win . __eou__
 I knew he would win . __eou__  How ’ d you know ? __eou__
 He was the best candidate this year . __eou__  What about him being black ? __eou__
I am so excited ! __eou__  Excited about what ? __eou__
 I just voted . __eou__  Is this the first time you ’ Ve voted ? __eou__
 Yes , I just had my 18th birthday this year . __eou__  That ’ s lucky . __eou__
 That ’ s lucky . __eou__  Why is that ? __eou__
 You turned 18 in an election year . __eou__  I didn ’ t think about it like that . __eou__
 I didn ’ t think about it like that . __eou__  Really ? __eou__
 No , but that makes me even more excited . __eou__  You ’ re a part of history . __eou__
 I voted today . __eou__  Was this your first time ? __eou__
 I just turned 18 a month ago . __eou__  You ’ re lucky . __eou__
 You ’ re lucky . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 Because you turned 18 in an election year . __eou__  I didn ’ t even think of that . __eou__
 I didn ’ t even think of that . __eou__  You didn ’ t ? __eou__
 I really didn ’ t , but I ’ m still excited . __eou__  You should be , because you ’ re a part of history . __eou__
 Of course ! __eou__  Who was your vote for President ? __eou__
 My vote was for Barack Obama . __eou__  I didn ’ t expect him to win . __eou__
 I didn ’ t expect him to win . __eou__  I had no doubt in my mind that he would win . __eou__
 I had no doubt in my mind that he would win . __eou__  What made you think that ? __eou__
 Nobody could compete with him . __eou__  I thought his race would have kept him from winning . __eou__
 I thought his race would have kept him from winning . __eou__  Times are changing . __eou__
 Times are changing . __eou__  That ’ s true . __eou__
 That ’ s true . __eou__  I support our new President 100 % . __eou__
National Trust . __eou__  My name is Alice Lin , and I need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet . __eou__
 You know I did . __eou__  Who did you vote for ? __eou__
 I voted for Obama , of course ! __eou__  Can you believe that he actually won ? __eou__
 I knew he would win . __eou__  I didn ’ t think he would . __eou__
 I didn ’ t think he would . __eou__  He was the top candidate . __eou__
 He was the top candidate . __eou__  I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American . __eou__
 I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American . __eou__  That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf . __eou__
 That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf . __eou__  You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__
 You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__  I ’ m excited that Barack Obama is our President . __eou__
 There are so many to choose from . I didn't know you could do all of this using a card . __eou__  That's the beauty of these machines , you can do almost anything . And unlike a person , they don't usually take breaks or go off sick ! __eou__
 Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see . __eou__  Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ? __eou__
 Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it . __eou__  Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you . __eou__
 Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people . __eou__  I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks . __eou__
 Not right away , you need to decide what it is you want to do . The next thing is to select the service . __eou__  Here we are ' withdrawal ' , so I just press here ? __eou__
 Yes , then enter the amount you want . __eou__  Oh , as simple as that ! I shall never wait for a real person again , these machines are wonderful . __eou__
Hello , Mr Kowalski ? __eou__  I'm here , hello . __eou__
 I'm here , hello . __eou__  Which city are you staying in right now ? And the name of your hotel ? __eou__
 I'm in Beijing , at the Weston Hotel . __eou__  Do you have your passport with you ? Or do you by any chance know the number ? __eou__
 Let me repeat that back to you , 16211469 9 . That's just what I've done , Mr Kowalski , I've stopped your card temporarily . __eou__  But , what do I do if I need cash ? __eou__
 You can go to any branch of IBA and request the Emergency Assistance Service . Everything will be taken care of , there's no need to worry . __eou__  Thank you so much . I'll find the nearest branch and come in tomorrow . Thanks again for all of your help . __eou__
 Client Services ? Oh , hello . I need your help . __eou__  Certainly , that's what we're here for . What can I help you with ? __eou__
 I'm a tourist in this city and unfortunately I've lost my card ! __eou__  Calm down , Sir . Is that an IBA Debit or Credit Card ? __eou__
 Credit Card . The International Credit Card , I can't find it anywhere . __eou__  Just calm down , Sir . OK , when do you think you lost it ? __eou__
 I'm not 100 % sure , around an hour ago I guess . I had it in the hotel lobby bar ; I used it to charge something to my room . I obviously didn't pick it up again . __eou__  That's fine , Sir . Let me just take some details FRCM you and we can help you . __eou__
 Yes , I did . But nobody has handed it in as yet . __eou__  OK , that's fine , Sir . We just need to ask you some questions for security purposes . __eou__
 I'm here to ask about a loan . __eou__  We have many loans on offer . May I ask what the purpose of the loan is ? __eou__
 I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child . I'd like to buy a car for the family . __eou__  I see . What you need is one of our Petty Consumer Loans . __eou__
 I see . What you need is one of our Petty Consumer Loans . __eou__  Could you tell me what the requirements are for that , please ? __eou__
 Yes , I do . I was born and bred here . __eou__  That's great . We'll also need details of your occupation . __eou__
 Haha ! Actually , I felt that your array of services is much better than what my old bank had on offer . Plus , I've got plenty of friends who bank with you and they are extremely happy . __eou__  We always welcome new business . If you can give me the details of your former bank , including your account number we can begin . __eou__
 That's right . Here you go . __eou__  Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... __eou__
 You are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 RIB , with a repayment period of up to 1 year . __eou__  That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . __eou__
 That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . __eou__  We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly . __eou__
 We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly . __eou__  How soon before this goes through ? __eou__
 If you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week . __eou__  Perfect . So , I guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . Thanks for everything . __eou__
 I already have some Time Deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . I really don't want to cash those just yet . __eou__  I understand completely . There are other options , such as a Personal Pledge Loan . __eou__
 Of course , we'll need some documentation from you . Like your resident permit , proof of salary and your USD Deposit Certificate , to use as collateral . __eou__  And then I just sign here ? You're right ! It certainly is simple and extremely convenient . __eou__
 I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations . You know , a bit of decorating , some new furniture , nothing flashy . __eou__  I see . And what loan amount are you expecting ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , Sir . The maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20,000 RIB , with no exceptions . __eou__  Well , 20,000 RIB , it'll have to be then . __eou__
 Well , 20,000 RIB , it'll have to be then . __eou__  I need some documentation from you . Such as your resident permit , your occupation and salary details and I already have your credit details here . __eou__
 The maximum maturity period is a year , but it also cannot exceed the maturity on the certificates used as collateral . __eou__  And the maximum loan amount ? __eou__
 The initial amount is just 2,000 RIB , but we can go up to 100,000 RIB . But remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral . __eou__  OK . I'll have a look at what I've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . Thanks for your help . Bye . __eou__
 OK . I'll have a look at what I've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . Thanks for your help . Bye . __eou__  My pleasure , Sir . Bye . __eou__
 I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan . __eou__  One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . __eou__
 One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . __eou__  So , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the PBC ? __eou__
 That is correct . __eou__  I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now . __eou__
 I already have . __eou__  How did you do that ? __eou__
 I mailed in an absentee ballot . __eou__  Why is that ? __eou__
 I can ’ t vote on Tuesday . __eou__  What ’ s the reason for that ? __eou__
 I have to go to work . __eou__  You can just go to work after you vote . __eou__
 I need to take care of some business that morning . __eou__  I get it now . __eou__
 I actually work here . __eou__  Fabulous . Thanks . __eou__
 Fabulous . Thanks . __eou__  Do you have ID ? __eou__
 Here ’ s your ballot card . __eou__  Now what am I supposed to do ? __eou__
 Just take it to a booth and begin voting . __eou__  Sounds good . Thanks . __eou__
 I already voted . __eou__  What do you mean you already voted ? __eou__
 I had to mail in an absentee ballot . __eou__  Why ’ d you have to do that ? __eou__
 I ’ m not going to be able to vote this Tuesday . __eou__  Why is that ? __eou__
 I have to work this Tuesday . __eou__  You can always go to work late . __eou__
 That same morning I have some business to take care of . __eou__  Oh , I understand . __eou__
 I ’ m so happy about that . __eou__  Did you vote for him ? __eou__

 I agree with you completely . __eou__  I ’ m not worried about our country now that it ’ s in his hands . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe that Obama won . __eou__  I couldn ’ t be happier to know that he ’ s our new President . __eou__
 I couldn ’ t be happier to know that he ’ s our new President . __eou__  I know ! He just made history ! __eou__

 I am proud to know that he is our President . __eou__  You voted for him , right ? __eou__
 I did , too . __eou__  I have nothing but faith in Obama . __eou__
 I have nothing but faith in Obama . __eou__  Really ? __eou__
 I ’ m sure he will help better America . __eou__  We do need some change in this country . __eou__

 You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__  I trust that he will take good care of our country . __eou__
 McCain is our new President . __eou__  You ’ re a liar ! __eou__
 You ’ re a liar ! __eou__  I ’ m not happy about it , either . __eou__
 I ’ m not happy about it , either . __eou__  Who voted for him ? __eou__
 I guess the people wanted him as our new leader . __eou__  That ’ s the dumbest thing that I ’ Ve ever heard . __eou__
 That ’ s the dumbest thing that I ’ Ve ever heard . __eou__  I have to tell you something else that you probably won ’ t like . __eou__
 I have to tell you something else that you probably won ’ t like . __eou__  What could be worse than what you just told me ? __eou__
 I wasn ’ t serious , because Obama got elected . __eou__  That ’ s fantastic ! You really got me there . __eou__
 I can believe it , and I am very excited about it . __eou__  I hope you voted for him . __eou__
 I hope you voted for him . __eou__  Of course I did . Didn ’ t you ? __eou__
 Of course ! __eou__  I have total faith in Obama as our President . __eou__

 Yeah . I have faith that he will help America turn over a new leaf . __eou__  Our country really could use some work . __eou__
 Our country really could use some work . __eou__  I believe that change has already begun . __eou__
 I believe that change has already begun . __eou__  I couldn ’ t agree more . __eou__

 I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate . __eou__  Would you like to ask me anything ? __eou__
 I think everyone has the right to love who they want . __eou__  Would you legalize gay marriage ? __eou__
 Yes , I would . __eou__  Many people won ’ t like that . __eou__
 Many people won ’ t like that . __eou__  I ’ m sure they won ’ t , but that ’ s my view on gay marriage . __eou__
 I ’ m sure they won ’ t , but that ’ s my view on gay marriage . __eou__  I really like you . __eou__
 I really like you . __eou__  I really appreciate that . __eou__
 I will be voting tomorrow . __eou__  What ’ s your polling place ? __eou__
 My polling place is at the park up the street . __eou__  Oh , yeah ? __eou__

 The location of my polling place never came in the mail . __eou__  You can always just check online . __eou__

 I see . __eou__  I want justice . __eou__
 They arrested me for nothing . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me . __eou__  Didn ’ t they let you go ? __eou__
 They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning . __eou__  So they kept you at the station ? __eou__
 They sure did . __eou__  Did they tell you why they arrested you ? __eou__
 I matched the description of a robbery suspect . __eou__  I understand . __eou__
 I understand . __eou__  I want to take them to court . __eou__
 There was no reason for them to arrest me . __eou__  They let you go , didn ’ t they ? __eou__
 They released me the next morning . __eou__  They detained you at the station ? __eou__
 That ’ s exactly what they did . __eou__  Why did they arrest you ? __eou__
 They said I matched the description of a robber . __eou__  I get it now . __eou__
 I get it now . __eou__  I ’ m definitely taking them to court . __eou__
 Did you know there was a blackout last night ? __eou__  Yes , I heard the lights were out all night . __eou__
 Yes , I heard the lights were out all night . __eou__  Well , some people decided to loot last night . __eou__
 Well , some people decided to loot last night . __eou__  I don't understand . __eou__
 I don't understand . __eou__  They took advantage of the blackout . __eou__
 They took advantage of the blackout . __eou__  They really started looting ? __eou__
 Yes , apparently four stores were broken into . __eou__  Did the looters get caught ? __eou__
 There was no evidence of who did it . __eou__  Hopefully we won't have any more blackouts . __eou__
 I haven't had a chance to see it . __eou__  You know about the blackout last night , right ? __eou__
 The lights were out everywhere . __eou__  A bunch of people went looting last night . __eou__
 A bunch of people went looting last night . __eou__  They what ? __eou__
 They took full advantage of the lights being out . __eou__  That's crazy . __eou__
 That's crazy . __eou__  The news reported that four stores were broken into . __eou__
 The news reported that four stores were broken into . __eou__  Were the looters found ? __eou__
 The police don't know who did it . __eou__  I hope this doesn't happen again . __eou__
 Yes . The lights were out all night . __eou__  Some people went looting because of the blackout . __eou__
 Some people went looting because of the blackout . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 People decided to use the blackout to their advantage . __eou__  People went out and looted ? __eou__
 I guess they broke into about four stores . __eou__  Did the police find who did it ? __eou__
 There's no evidence of who it was . __eou__  I hope we don't have any more blackouts . __eou__
 All the evidence indicates that you are guilty . __eou__  I realize that , but I am not guilty . __eou__
 I realize that , but I am not guilty . __eou__  Is that right ? __eou__
 I had nothing to do with the crime that was committed . __eou__  Who is the guilty party ? __eou__
 I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life . __eou__  How many of them were there ? __eou__
 Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions . __eou__  Like what ? __eou__
 Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that . __eou__  What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ? __eou__
 I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning . __eou__  Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years . __eou__
 Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years . __eou__  Hmm . Thank you very much . __eou__
Good evening , sir . I understand that you have been robbed . __eou__  I certainly have . __eou__
 I certainly have . __eou__  When did this happen ? __eou__
 About two hours ago . __eou__  Why didn't you report it before ? __eou__
 I couldn't . I was bound and gagged . __eou__  Please tell me exactly what happened . __eou__
 I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door . Without thinking , I opened it . __eou__  That wasn't very wise , sir . __eou__
 That wasn't very wise , sir . __eou__  I know . I was expecting my wife , you see , and thought it was her . __eou__
 I know . I was expecting my wife , you see , and thought it was her . __eou__  You should never open a door without looking to see who it is . __eou__
 Two men pushed into the flat . One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me . __eou__  Did you get a good look at them ? __eou__
 I'm afraid not . They were both wearing stockings over their faces . __eou__  What did they take ? __eou__
 My wallet , with $ 200 in it , my wrist watch.some of my wife's jewellery from our bedroom , and a silver photoframe . __eou__  They don't seem to have done much damage to the flat . __eou__
 They don't seem to have done much damage to the flat . __eou__  No . They had just begun to search when the dogs next door began to bark . Theran off then leaving me bound and gagged . It was some time before my wifereturned and released me . I phoned the police at o __eou__
 No . They had just begun to search when the dogs next door began to bark . Theran off then leaving me bound and gagged . It was some time before my wifereturned and released me . I phoned the police at o __eou__  My men began searching the area as soon as we received your call . I can't promise you that we'll recover your property but we'll certainly do our best . __eou__
 I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . __eou__  I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . __eou__
 I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . __eou__  I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . __eou__
 I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . __eou__  For example ? __eou__
 Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . __eou__  Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . __eou__
 No , I haven ’ t , but I thought about joining the green party . __eou__  Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ’ t you ? __eou__
 Yes . I was . But I didn ’ t have enough time to devote to it . __eou__  The green party have no chance of winning an election . The other parties are too big and popular . __eou__
 The green party have no chance of winning an election . The other parties are too big and popular . __eou__  You ’ re right . But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties . Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness __eou__
 You ’ re right . But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties . Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness __eou__  Most people are not very politically aware . They often don ’ t understand the issues fully . __eou__
 Most people are not very politically aware . They often don ’ t understand the issues fully . __eou__  That ’ s true . But it ’ s a little strange because the media often reports on political events . You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv . __eou__
 hello ! I was exhausted form studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the pole __eou__  people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . __eou__
 people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . __eou__  you mean if they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . __eou__
 you mean if they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . __eou__  there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . __eou__
 there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . __eou__  well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? __eou__
 yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . __eou__  well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment . __eou__
 well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment . __eou__  I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . __eou__
 I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . __eou__  I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! __eou__
 I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! __eou__  don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . __eou__
 We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . __eou__  Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? __eou__
 Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist __eou__  What ’ s a cabinet ? __eou__
 This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . __eou__  Can any mp make a law ? __eou__
 Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . __eou__  I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . __eou__
 I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . __eou__  Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . __eou__
 Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . __eou__  How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? __eou__
Hello . Gail Willows speaking . __eou__  Ms Willows , hello . This is Daniel calling from IBA Bank . __eou__
 Ms Willows , hello . This is Daniel calling from IBA Bank . __eou__  Hello , Daniel . What can I do for you ? __eou__
 I'm calling to notify you that an Export L / C has arrived for you . __eou__  Oh , really ? Do you know which company it's from ? __eou__
 Yes , it's from Satura Beds of Tokyo . __eou__  Ah , great ! I'll send someone over to pick it up . Thanks for calling . __eou__
 I've come in to give you the documents under the L / C we opened , the new one . This lot are from Singapore , a new customer . __eou__  Have you had a chance to go through them yet ? __eou__
 Yes , with a fine toothed comb , as usual . Everything seems fine , except for one thing . The description of the items we are purchasing is a little different from what we expected . __eou__  Is it a big difference ? __eou__
 No , I haven't . It is the first time for me to come to deposit money here . __eou__  How long do you want to keep it in our bank ? __eou__
 Two years , please . __eou__  You have to fill in this form with your name , address , ID card number , deposit term and the amount you want to deposit . __eou__
 Don't worry . You can draw your money at any time . But you'll not receive the time deposit return of interest . What we can offer is a current one . __eou__  I see . By the way , what if I forget to cash my money when the maturity comes ? __eou__
 In that case , we'll just regard your account as a regular savings account from then on . __eou__  I see . __eou__
 Certainly , Visible Treasury Certificates . Then you can get a receipt from the savings office as proof of payment . Hence the ' visible ' , you can see it . __eou__  Ah , right . How much do I need to spend ? __eou__
 The minimum is 100 RIB , and the maximum is 500,000 RIB . __eou__  How about Bearer Certificates ? Are they different ? __eou__
 Your balance today is 120,376 RIB . __eou__  Fine , I'll take 10,000 RIB , please . __eou__
 OK . Please fill in this form and input you code here ... and again , please . I'll just check and see if the money has been transferred . Yes , transaction successful . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
Not only does it centralise management , it also increases the efficiency of funds . We have testimonials from various companies who are very happy with the service . __eou__  Yes , I'm sure you do . It sounds like an excellent service . __eou__
 Yes , I'm sure you do . It sounds like an excellent service . __eou__  You see , nowadays , a lot of companies are concerned about their group account management . As long as your company meets all the requirements of our Group Account Deposit Service , I would fully recommend it . __eou__
 You see , nowadays , a lot of companies are concerned about their group account management . As long as your company meets all the requirements of our Group Account Deposit Service , I would fully recommend it . __eou__  It seems perfect . __eou__
 It seems perfect . __eou__  Here are some leaflets detailing everything we've discussed . __eou__
 Here are some leaflets detailing everything we've discussed . __eou__  Could you also let me view some of the testimonials ? I'd really be interested to see what other group companies thought of this service . __eou__
 That is one option , Madam . If your are travelling to either Hong Kong or Macau we are permitted to exchange up to 1,000 USD for you . __eou__  OK , I see . What's the exchange rate ? Is the dollar up or down ? __eou__
 Today's rate is 823 . 71 RIB to 100 USD . __eou__  To be honest , I have no idea about these things ! But I'm sure that's alright . __eou__
 To be honest , I have no idea about these things ! But I'm sure that's alright . __eou__  Yes , it's not bad . I will need to see your passport though . __eou__
 Yes , it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . To make full use of the Network Settlement Service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few . __eou__  So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ? __eou__
 This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies . __eou__  What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ? __eou__
 Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . __eou__  I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ... __eou__
 Yes . I received everything in the post this morning . __eou__  That's good . Could I please see the originals of everything ? __eou__
 You're pretty lucky actually , today is higher than yesterday . It's 824 . 71 RIB for 100 USD . __eou__  Great ! Do you need me to sign anything ? __eou__
Let me tell you some more . The interest is settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter , It's paid quarterly . Of course it also needs to be settled if you cancel the account . __eou__  Miao Ping , in your opinion , should we go for the Type A or Type B Account ? __eou__
 My nephew has told me about something called a ' timing deposit ' or something like that ? __eou__  A T-I-M-E , Time Deposit . You can chose from 5 different grades __eou__
 A T-I-M-E , Time Deposit . You can chose from 5 different grades __eou__  Put me down for 2 years . Here's the money I'd like to pay in ... __eou__
 Next week , so I thought it was better to get this all sorted out as soon as possible . __eou__  Yes , of course . Well , let's get started . Would you show me your passport , please ? __eou__
 It's a little embarrassing really ; you see I think I've got a counterfeit note . __eou__  Do you remember where you got it ? __eou__
 No , I don't . Usually I'm very careful about checking the money I'm given , but for some reason this one slipped through . __eou__  Counterfeit notes these days can be very sophisticated and difficult to spot with the naked eye . But I must warn you that if it does show to be a counterfeit I have no option but to confiscate it . __eou__
 Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me . __eou__  The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check . __eou__
 Here's your Passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 RIB worth of counterfeit notes . __eou__  Thanks . Now can I make the full deposit ? __eou__
 Yes , I'm sorry about that . One of our Atms is down and we are waiting for it to be repaired , but it should be up and running again very soon . __eou__  I see . Here's my Bank Book . __eou__
 That's a very popular way to pay nowadays , totally hassle free ! __eou__  Yes , that's what I thought . It's so much trouble coming down here or to the post office to pay all of my utility bills every month . So , what exactly do I need to do ? __eou__
 We usually ask for 100 RIB , Sir . __eou__  OK , here you go . __eou__
 Yes , right here . __eou__  Great . Please fill them out on this deposit slip . __eou__
 1,000 RIB . __eou__  Not just a thoughtful granddad , but a generous one too . __eou__
 Not just a thoughtful granddad , but a generous one too . __eou__  It's an important birthday . __eou__
 Correct . __eou__  Please enter your PIN number on the keypad . __eou__
 Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it . __eou__  Oh , I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew . __eou__
 Hello , Ms Li , this is Mr Peng . __eou__  Hello , Mr Peng , how nice to hear from you again . What can I do for you today ? __eou__
 Yes , I know , but I need the money urgently for a family emergency , you see . I know I should apply in writing if I wish to withdraw , but I'm afraid there just isn't time . __eou__  The regulations state that the interest is paid at the rate of a Current Deposit , so unfortunately you will lose some interest . __eou__
 The regulations state that the interest is paid at the rate of a Current Deposit , so unfortunately you will lose some interest . __eou__  Well , it can't be helped . I really must have that money . Thank you . __eou__
 Yes , my name is Ms Jane Reeve , R-E-E-V-E . __eou__  Ah , yes , Ms Reeve . I have all of your information here . Do you have the cash cheque ? __eou__
 I'm sorry Ms Reeve , it says 45,000 RIB here . __eou__  Oh , how silly of me . Can we correct it here ? __eou__
 Oh , hello , yes , arm ... I've just lost my bank stuff . __eou__  I'm sorry , could you be a little more specific ? __eou__
 You know my bank stuff . My card , my book ... __eou__  OK , I will have to take some details from you . Could you tell me your name , please ? __eou__
 I spoke to a girl named Claire on the phone ; it's about losing my card and everything . __eou__  What I need you to do first is fill in these forms , with as much detail as possible . Then we can get you a new card . __eou__
 I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything . __eou__  7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ? __eou__
Mr Moon , how good to see you again . __eou__  Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ? __eou__
 Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . __eou__  What if I exceed ? __eou__
 If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw . __eou__  Right , I see . It all sounds pretty complicated to me . I think I'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what I want to do . __eou__
 It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits . __eou__  So , if I do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ? __eou__
 I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit . __eou__  Unfortunately , if you wish to withdraw on your C / D before the pre-decided date , you must give notice . __eou__
 Yes , you will lose interest . I see that you have a 5 - year C / D with us . I'm sorry to tell you that would mean losing 6 months of interest as a penalty for withdrawing before maturity . __eou__  Oh dear . Well , if it has to be done , then it has to be done . __eou__
 Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity . __eou__  This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ? __eou__
 Well , the account's in my name . Patrick Dean , that's D-E-A-N . The account number is 15273478841 . There was about 20,000 RIB inside . __eou__  OK , Sir . Almost there , I just need your PIN number . When we issue you with a new card and book we would recommend that you change your PIN number . It's a very simple procedure . __eou__
Good morning , Sir . __eou__  Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ? __eou__
 10,000 Japanese yen . __eou__  OK , Sir . Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit ? __eou__
 You see , I have these Euros , and of course they are of no use to me at the moment . So I'd like to save them in my account , but I'm not sure how to go about it . __eou__  OK . We offer 2 types of saving systems , Time Savings and Demand Savings . With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time , but with Demand Savings your money is ' on demand ' , you can withdraw at any time . __eou__
 OK . We offer 2 types of saving systems , Time Savings and Demand Savings . With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time , but with Demand Savings your money is ' on demand ' , you can withdraw at any time . __eou__  I see . What's the interest like on those ? __eou__
 That shouldn't be a problem , Mr Fang . Have you got your Certificate of Use of Foreign Exchange Account and the Foreign Exchange Account Opening Notice with you ? Our most widely used currencies are US dollar , Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollar . __eou__  I need to open a US dollar account , trade with America is going up each year . __eou__
 We will transact this for you as soon as we can after the materials you have given me have been checked and verified . __eou__  Good , thanks . I look forward to hearing from you . __eou__
 Yes , that's what my husband advised me to do . But I'm not sure how long I should save for . __eou__  Well , we offer 5 grades as standard __eou__
 Well , we offer 5 grades as standard __eou__  Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ? __eou__
 For 6 months we can offer you 0.59 % . __eou__  That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go . __eou__
 Yes , yes , we do . Right here . __eou__  Right . You have a choice of account , we provide USD , HAD , JOY and GAP accounts . Which do you want to go for ? __eou__
 Today's rate is 821.32 USD to 100 RIB , which isn't bad . __eou__  That sounds pretty good . OK , I'll change 500 USD today , thanks . __eou__
 At the moment it's 830.43 RIB for 100 USD , which is a pretty good rate . __eou__  OK , that sounds fine . I think 200 USD worth of RIB should be plenty , thanks . __eou__
 I think 250 dollars should be sufficient . __eou__  Please fill out this exchange form and I'll need to see your passport . Don't forget to sign your name at the bottom . __eou__
 Kula Lumpur , in Malaysia . __eou__  That's fine . If you are travelling outside of Mainland China , Hong Kong and Macao we need to follow the SAFE rules . This means that you can exchange 2,000 USD or equivalent . __eou__
 With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly . __eou__  That is wonderful . We've been having serious problems in that area . Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment , nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money . __eou__
 That is wonderful . We've been having serious problems in that area . Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment , nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money . __eou__  Hopefully signing up for this Network Settlement Service will solve all of that . If you are sure , we can go ahead now , Sir . How does 10 am tomorrow sound , to get all of the paperwork out of the way ? __eou__
 Yes , that's right . __eou__  I just need to see some identification before I hand over the cash . __eou__
 That's no problem . There are 3 ways you can do this , firstly you can send the money account to account , or you can choose to send cash to account or you can send cash to individual . Which service would you like ? __eou__  I think account to individual would be best . But which is the quickest way ? __eou__
 No problem . Could I have the cash and your Bank Book , please ? Oh dear ... there seems to be some problems here ... __eou__  What ? What's wrong ? __eou__
 Yes . I've received this Remittance Advice from the bank . __eou__  Could I take a look at it , please ? Let me just check these details ... right . __eou__
 Mr CK Chen contacted me this morning and asked me to come in for the remittance . __eou__  I've got the details here . 10,000 RIB sent by Mr CK Chen from Guangzhou . Could I see some ID ? You passport , for example ? __eou__
 Haha ! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars . __eou__  Yes , I guess you are right . So , do you need my passport ? __eou__
 I'm the accountant with Go Thong Computers . __eou__  Ah , yes . Mr Can , isn't it ? Yes , the money has been transferred successfully . But you'll need to change it into RIB before you can have it . __eou__
 That's a relief ! I was a little worried about it ; I left England in a bit of a hurry . __eou__  How much would you like to change ? __eou__
 I've just had some money sent from Germany , in Euros . __eou__  OK , could you give me your details and I'll see if it has cleared . We need your banking details and some ID . A passport or something like that ? __eou__
 Mr Jurgen , yes , the remittance has been successful . __eou__  That was quick ! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly . Yes , that is good news . The full amount should be 20,000 Euros , is that right ? I'd like to withdraw 5,000 Euros worth of local currency , if that's possible . __eou__
 I've lost my Traveller's Cheques , all of them . __eou__  OK , just take a deep breath , Sir . Everything is going to be fine . Here's a form to report missing Traveller's Cheques , whatever the reason . Please fill it in and we can get moving on this . __eou__
 We do always recommend people take Traveller's Cheques when travelling overseas . The world is a dangerous place nowadays , you never know . __eou__  Sure . At least if I do get robbed , heaven forbid , I can get my money back using the traveller's cheques insurance . Once , when I was travelling in France , I was pick-pocketed and not only did you replace my Traveller's Cheques for free , you also did it extremely quickly and easily . __eou__
Good morning . __eou__  Ah , hello . Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques ? __eou__
 As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us , you are covered . No matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly . All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques . We will need that number if you need to make a claim . __eou__  OK , I'd like to purchase 500 US dollars worth of Traveller's Cheques , please . __eou__
 Recently it's been pretty good , actually . __eou__  That's what we like to hear , a profitable business . __eou__
 That's what we like to hear , a profitable business . __eou__  Well , yes . Thanks , there's no trouble at the moment . __eou__
 Well , yes . Thanks , there's no trouble at the moment . __eou__  So , what can I do for you today ? Are you needing to withdraw or transfer ? __eou__
 I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount , you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back . __eou__  You mean , if there is any left over ? __eou__
 Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system . __eou__  Right , so the deposit , if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification ? __eou__
 Yes , I recalled you charging that before . And I thought it was extortionate ! Haha ! __eou__  I can just take it from your account , you don't need to give me cash . __eou__
 Hello . My aunt in the US has sent me $ 500 . She sent it yesterday , using the standard service . It's my birthday today , you see . __eou__  Well , happy birthday . If it was sent yesterday using the usual service , it should be here already . You do have an account with us , right ? __eou__
 Ms Ling ! It's Mr Gwent , from Montgomery Computers . __eou__  Hello , Mr Gwent . What can I do for you today ? __eou__
 Deutsche Bank . It was 25,000 US dollars . __eou__  Yes , here it is . That's received and cleared , so it's available for withdrawal . __eou__
 Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled . __eou__  Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ? __eou__
 We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not . __eou__  That's not a problem . __eou__
 That's not a problem . __eou__  Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you . __eou__
 Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you . __eou__  Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers . __eou__
 We've just started a new business at this bank , Bank-Insurance Link . __eou__  Could you give me some details about that ? __eou__
 Certainly . It could really benefit someone like you . Besides insurance for you , you can also get more or less dividends from the insurance company . __eou__  That sounds great . More dividends if I want to purchase them ! __eou__
 That sounds great . More dividends if I want to purchase them ! __eou__  There are two different types that we are offering at the moment , Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . __eou__
 There are two different types that we are offering at the moment , Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . __eou__  I'll go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly . Thanks . __eou__
 That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . __eou__  And I can purchase that here ? __eou__
 I started a new job last month and I'm expecting my first salary . __eou__  I see . And your company has a Wage Distribution Service Agreement with us ? __eou__
 So I was told , yes . They gave me this book ? __eou__  Yes , that's a Current-all-in-one Passbook . That's what you need to get your salary . __eou__
 It's possible to sign an agreement with us , and then we can pay your staff directly . That is called an Entrustment Agreement . __eou__  I see . How is it paid ? I mean , what payment methods are possible ? __eou__
 We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account . It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account , no matter which bank they do business with . __eou__  That sounds pretty good . Tell me , must we use the same payment method for all of our employees ? __eou__
 Not at all . We can adjust the payment methods depending on the requirement of each employee . __eou__  That sounds just perfect . I'll talk things over with some colleagues and get back to you . Thank you very much for the information . __eou__
 To be honest , I haven't really done much research . __eou__  I would recommend that you at least glance through these brochures , just to make sure that you have selected the right policy for you . Take your time , Sir . __eou__
 It's actually a Deposit Account that links to your Margin Account , the one you have with the Securities Company . You can transfer the money you have in your account into your Fund Account . __eou__  How can I do that ? __eou__
 Well , it certainly makes everything easier , both at this end and at your end . __eou__  OK . Here's my account details . __eou__
 Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank . Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up . __eou__  Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ? __eou__
 Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution . __eou__  So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ? __eou__
 Technically , yes . __eou__  OK , I think I've got it . __eou__
 Yes . I've already got a fund account with you too . __eou__  How many more fund units would you like to purchase today ? __eou__
 I'm not quite sure . You see , I already have more than 5,000 RIB in my cash card , but I really don't know how much I should get . __eou__  The usual minimum purchase is 5,000 RIB . __eou__
 I see . The Fund Trading System of our Net Banking deals with both trading and information . If you use this system , you can subscribe for and apply to buy other funds . You can also get lots of other useful information . __eou__  Regarding what exactly ? __eou__
 You remember me ! Yes , I'm with Li Wang Enterprises ; I'm the Accountant Peters . __eou__  Yes , of course , Mr Peters ! Good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? __eou__
 The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1.2 % . But for redeeming , a rate of a usual 0.5 % , we shall charge you 1.6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period . __eou__  So , it's going to cost me then ? __eou__
 Yes . I'm sorry , but I've lost my passbook . __eou__  Well . Can you tell me how much you have deposited ? __eou__
 About RIB 12,000 . __eou__  Please let me have your name and your savings account number if you remember it . __eou__
 I'm Bob Brown . But I can't recall my account number . __eou__  Don't worry , Mr . Brown . Let me try to check it for you . One moment , please . Yes , I have your account number here . The balance is exactly RIB 12,000 __eou__
 Don't worry , Mr . Brown . Let me try to check it for you . One moment , please . Yes , I have your account number here . The balance is exactly RIB 12,000 __eou__  Thank goodness . It is still there . Thank you very much . __eou__
 Thank goodness . It is still there . Thank you very much . __eou__  It's my pleasure . Please fill out this lost passbook bill and list the code word you used when you first opened your account . __eou__
 Hello , yes , I opened an L / C with you recently . We opened it 7 days ago . __eou__  If you could show me your details , please . What can I do ? __eou__
 2,000 AD $ . __eou__  Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ? __eou__
 The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one . __eou__  Well , I think the cable is better . __eou__
 If you take M / T , it will take a longer time for your brother to receive the money . __eou__  OK . I'll take T / T . __eou__
 You are welcome . __eou__  Bye-bye . __eou__
 I received a letter asking me to come in and see you . I'm Mr Simons from Dalton's Electrics . __eou__  Oh , yes . Hello Mr Simons . I have some information about your L / C amendment . The negotiating bank has just informed us that the 3rd party does not wish to accept the amendment . __eou__
 Oh , yes . Hello Mr Simons . I have some information about your L / C amendment . The negotiating bank has just informed us that the 3rd party does not wish to accept the amendment . __eou__  Oh dear ! Where should I go from here ? __eou__
Hello , JC Consulting PLC . Chris Edwards speaking . __eou__  Mr Edwards , this is Kristy calling from IBA . __eou__
 Mr Edwards , this is Kristy calling from IBA . __eou__  Hi Kristy ! What's going on ? __eou__
 Yes , I certainly do . __eou__  The negotiating bank has just been in touch ... __eou__
 The negotiating bank has just been in touch ... __eou__  Oh , dear ! There isn't a problem , is there ? __eou__
 No , Mr Edwards , not at all . We are contacting you to let you know that everything has gone smoothly and the amendment has been accepted . __eou__  Kristy , that's wonderful ! Thanks so much for contacting me personally . __eou__
 We'll have our own Secure Internet Banking Service . What it is , is a sort of online financial service for enterprises and individuals , so you could get it . It's for doing all types of e-business . __eou__  That does sound interesting . How can I get this service ? __eou__
 It's TH 15699324873 0 . __eou__  OK , just checking for you ... yes , they have arrived . How would you like me to handle them ? __eou__
 Let me find that on my screen ... yes , the L / C is right here . I'm sorry ; the documents don't seem to be here yet . __eou__  Oh , dear . When do you think they will arrive ? __eou__
 Personal Internet Banking is a self service financial service that is based on the Internet . It can be used by both businesses and individuals . We offer an online payment service , Personal Net Banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . You can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ... __eou__  That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills . __eou__
 Yes , that's correct , Madam . You don't need to go to a counter at all , you can use one of our ATM machines . I'll be more than happy to help you . __eou__  I don't usually like to use Atms , I like dealing with a real person , you see . __eou__
 I don't usually like to use Atms , I like dealing with a real person , you see . __eou__  I know it does seem a little daunting , but once you get used to it , it will save you a lot of time and trouble . __eou__
 That's not a problem , I'm more than happy to explain everything in laymen's terms . PIN stands for Personal Internet Banking . You can do all of your usual banking using the Internet , no need to call __eou__  I see . How about buying and selling items ? __eou__
 That was a wise decision , if I may say so . Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions , payment of household bills online , account management ... __eou__  I will probably just use it for online shopping . At the moment , I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash , if it's a local seller . __eou__
 I will probably just use it for online shopping . At the moment , I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash , if it's a local seller . __eou__  This will fix all of that for you . If you use our online payment service , the money will come straight out of your account and go directly into the seller's account , in a secure way . __eou__
 Right . If the cheque is coming from the US , into a local currency account it will take 7 working days to clear . __eou__  Is there any way we can speed it up ? __eou__
 That depends . Our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . The Fixed Asset Loan is a long-term loan , you see . The loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs . __eou__  And how much is payable in each instalment ? __eou__
 You will need to pay part of the principle sum and part of the interest due . __eou__  Well , as far as I can see , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . You've sold me ! I'd like to go ahead . __eou__
 My home phone , the landline . I don't have a mobile phone , far too complicated for an old lady like me ! Do you need my Bank Book ? __eou__  I'll need your Bank Card , please . Your Bank Book is required for over the counter services ; with the ATM you just need to have your card . __eou__
 Let's get started . First , select the service you require . That's household bill payment for you . Then we select the type of bill , so that's landline ... here you go . Your bill for this month comes to 87.42 RIB . The money will come out of your account and go straight to the phone company . __eou__  Well , that is easy ! It sure beats waiting in line for ages waiting to deal with a real person ! __eou__
The ATM machine outside won't give me back my card . __eou__  Let's go take a look at it . Do you have your ID with you ? __eou__
 Yes , here it is . __eou__  Okay , I see the problem . You forgot your code , didn't you ? __eou__
 The machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it . __eou__  Oh . But can I have my card back now ? __eou__
 I do , at a different location , I have a savings account and a CD . __eou__  In that case , we will need to fill out this paperwork . Do you have identification with you ? __eou__
 Yes , luckily our office is just down the street . __eou__  Great . I shall also need a copy of your own ID and the Warrant Letter , you can fill in one here . __eou__
 I have a Promissory Note , but it's not called that . It's a Bill of Exchange . __eou__  Similar to a Promissory Note , yes . I can deal with that for you right here . The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation . __eou__
 Similar to a Promissory Note , yes . I can deal with that for you right here . The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation . __eou__  So , even if someone wasn't directly involved , they can become involved ? Like the bank you cash it in ? __eou__
 That's right . We didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . So , we become involved . __eou__  I see . Sorry about this , I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before ! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out . __eou__
 I see . Sorry about this , I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before ! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out . __eou__  As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about . __eou__
 There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years . __eou__  Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem . __eou__
 Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem . __eou__  And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year . __eou__
 And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year . __eou__  Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify . __eou__
 Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify . __eou__  Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed . __eou__
 Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period . __eou__  Is there any flexibility on that ? __eou__
 Yes , Sir . We can provide these loans in both local and foreign currency , Temporary Working Capital Loans , Short-term Working Capital Loans and Mid-term Working Capital Loans . __eou__  I see ... __eou__
 I see ... __eou__  Which one interests you , Sir ? __eou__
 Yes . I also have a Loan Certificate . __eou__  Oh , that's good . We will come to our final decision based on your credit rating , the payment capability ... __eou__
 It's a bit of a problem situation , actually ... you see , our company has a Corporate Account with you , but unfortunately , we've been experiencing cash flow problems recently . __eou__  I'm sorry to hear that . We value all of our customers , regardless of circumstances . What can we do to help ? __eou__
 Yes , I am . But I'm not sure if I'm eligible . __eou__  To find out if you are eligible for our Fixed Asset Loan , we will have to look at various aspects of your business , such as your long-term business prospects , your cash flow , your profitability , your capital structure ... __eou__
 Hello , this is the Corporate Department of Lincoln Bank calling . We are calling to let you know that some documents have arrived for you at our bank . __eou__  Oh , really ? Do you know which company they are from ? __eou__
 It's 150 RIB for the service . __eou__  That seems pretty reasonable . Thanks . __eou__
 Yes , I have known of it . __eou__  How much do you like to exchange ? __eou__
 Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , it has . I've been in Saudi Arabia for the last 6 weeks on business . I did have a little time to relax in Dubai , though . __eou__  I envy you , Mr Meng ! What can I do for you today ? __eou__
Hello . __eou__  Hello . Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__
 If you open a fixed account , the interest rate is higher . __eou__  Then how about the current account ? __eou__
 You may withdraw the money at any time . You just need to present your deposit book . __eou__  Thank you for your help . I think I'll open a current account . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Good . Everything is done . Here is your deposit book and ID card . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  It's my pleasure . __eou__
 L / C stands for ' letter of credit ' . This is necessary for trade between two countries . A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . Nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too . __eou__  So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street ! __eou__
 OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates . __eou__  OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ? __eou__
 Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds . __eou__  That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead ! __eou__
 I'm having a little trouble with this form . __eou__  What seems to be the problem ? __eou__
 There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want . __eou__  That's right , there's ' revocable ' and ' irrevocable ' . We usually go for the irrevocable one , it's the most popular . __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  The term of time deposit ranges from three months to five years , including three months , six months , one year , two years , three years and five years . How long would you like to keep your deposit ? __eou__
 All right . Just a moment , please . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Very carefully , that's when I found the problem . __eou__  Ah , I see . The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ? __eou__
 Yes . My Manager sent me in , there's a problem with the shipping time . It's been delayed quite significantly and my manager is unwilling to accept it . __eou__  You will need to return the documents . That's no problem ; we can deal with that for you now . __eou__
 Actually , there is a problem . It's the goods description , it's a little different on the invoice , but this does happen sometimes . __eou__  No , everything has to be perfect . __eou__
 No , everything has to be perfect . __eou__  No problem , I'll just get the form for you . __eou__
 Yes , I'm back ! It's nice to see you again . I'm here about those documents . __eou__  Ah yes , the ones from Sapporo we were dealing with yesterday ? __eou__
 Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ... __eou__  Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee . __eou__
 Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee . __eou__  The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars . __eou__
 The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars . __eou__  That's wonderful news ! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem . __eou__
 I see , here it says KM509 . __eou__  Exactly , if we accept these it could cause a lot of problems in our record and our accounts system because the numbers don't match . __eou__
 Exactly , if we accept these it could cause a lot of problems in our record and our accounts system because the numbers don't match . __eou__  Yes , I see what you mean . You need to reject these documents . __eou__
 Oh , yes . I remember . You must be Mr Xie . It's nice to put a face to a voice . __eou__  Yes , it sure is . The L / C number is JD185649000023 . __eou__
 Yes , it sure is . The L / C number is JD185649000023 . __eou__  JD185649000023 ? Yes , found it . 175,000 Euros , is that correct ? JD185649000023 ? __eou__
 The account is a compound savings account , which is in RIB and Forex . __eou__  Do I get a card ? __eou__
 Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours . __eou__  How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account . __eou__
 The interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our Personal Financing . __eou__  That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? __eou__
 I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ? __eou__  Yes , that's right . We have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already . __eou__
 Yes , that's right . We have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already . __eou__  I also read that if the customer is a stock investor , which I am , it's possible to get additional benefits ? __eou__
 Right again . We can provide a tailored consultation service for you , giving you the latest quotes from the Stock Exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments . __eou__  What if I don't want to come in to the branch , can I use the consultation service over the phone ? __eou__
 The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! __eou__  I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? __eou__
 I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . __eou__  Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . __eou__
 Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . __eou__  I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . __eou__
 I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . __eou__  That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . __eou__
 That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . __eou__  And for the Savings Deposit ? __eou__
 For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . __eou__  Wow ! A third more ? Very good . __eou__
 I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc . It sounds just perfect for me , as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance . __eou__  Yes , that's just one of the services we offer in our Personal Financing Program . __eou__
 Yes , that's just one of the services we offer in our Personal Financing Program . __eou__  What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on . I mean , some days I buy and sell quite a lot . Some days , there's no activity at all . __eou__
 I certainly do . Here it is , an Export L / C from Tokyo . __eou__  It should be from Sayuri Beds . Is that right ? __eou__
 Yes , it is . Sayuri Beds , Tokyo , Japan . __eou__  That's what I want ! Do you need me to sign anything ? Or fill in some forms ? __eou__
 It certainly is . You can do almost anything with it , anytime , anywhere . __eou__  How would I go about applying for this service ? __eou__
 That's not a problem . You can use that service wherever you are , it doesn't matter which country you are in at the time . __eou__  Really ? In that case , could I have the number of the Service Centre please ? __eou__
 That's the beauty of the service ; they can deal with everything , with total security . __eou__  That's good to know . Thanks . __eou__
 Yes , that is our Personal Wealth Management Service . __eou__  Could you tell me more ? __eou__
 Certainly . We can arrange the structure to suit whatever you require . That's why this service is so popular ; it's suitable for everyone because we make it that way . __eou__  This is just what I've been looking for . Sign me up right away , please . __eou__
 I have it right here . __eou__  Great . Can I take it with me now ? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ? __eou__
 Hello , this is Miao Eng calling from Lincoln Bank . __eou__  B :: Miao Eng ! I'd know that voice anywhere . What can I do for you ? Any problems ? __eou__
 No , not at all . I was just calling to tell you that everything has been checked and double checked , and there is no problem with the documents you brought in this morning . __eou__  That is good news . __eou__
 That is good news . __eou__  Shall I go ahead and process them for you ? __eou__
 Thank you . I don't think there should be any problems , but just to be sure ... __eou__  Don't worry ; I'm sure it will be fine . If I do have any queries I'll call you , OK ? __eou__
 It's NX567822100007 . __eou__  Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving . __eou__
 Hello , this is Quinn from IBA . __eou__  Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ? __eou__
 I'm afraid so , yes . __eou__  Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ? __eou__
 Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake . __eou__  What do you recommend we do ? __eou__
 I've prepared some L / C documents , all in accordance with the conditions . There shouldn't be any problems ; I've done about a million of these things recently . __eou__  You're right , no problems . You are becoming quite the expert , Mr Lawson . If any problem does turn up , which I'm sure it won't , I'll give you a call . __eou__
Good morning , Felix Wasserman Associates . Beth Jennings speaking . __eou__  This is James Hong calling from Lincoln Bank . __eou__
 This is James Hong calling from Lincoln Bank . __eou__  Hello , Mr Hong . What can I do for you ? __eou__
 I'm calling to let you know that the funds for NX567822100007 have arrived . __eou__  That's great ! That was quick , after it not being there yesterday I wasn't expecting to hear from you for a while . __eou__
 That's great ! That was quick , after it not being there yesterday I wasn't expecting to hear from you for a while . __eou__  Well , it's here now . Shall we credit that straight to your account ? __eou__
 500 dollars , please . __eou__  Please wait for a moment ... Now here is your Chinese currency . See if it's right . It's 3,220 yuan . Please keep this exchange memo . You may need it for converting when you leave China . __eou__
 Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state . __eou__  That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought . __eou__
 That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought . __eou__  Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more . __eou__
 Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more . __eou__  That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James ! __eou__
 That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James ! __eou__  Bye ! __eou__
 We can change only three kinds of currency , USD , Japanese Yen and HK Dollar in our savings office . __eou__  Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ? __eou__
 The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars . __eou__  I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here . __eou__
 Oh , it's a service charge . __eou__  But I only have 900 in cash here . Can you let it go for 900 yuan ? __eou__
 Yes . __eou__  Great . Here it is . __eou__
 Great . Here it is . __eou__  Here is the receipt . Wanna to have it wrapped , Ma'am ? __eou__
 Yes , please . Thank you very much . __eou__  It'll be great to have you again . __eou__
 It'll be great to have you again . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Yes , I do . Here it is , and the cash . __eou__  Wait a moment , please . __eou__
 The deposit rate is 0.8 % every month . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 This rate is one percent . That will be 10 Yuan . __eou__  OK , when will this remittance arrive ? __eou__
 Generally it will arrive within a week . __eou__  That's good . Is there anything else ? __eou__
 I said by the middle of October . This is the best we can promise . __eou__  All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September . __eou__
 We generally insure W . P . ( W . P . A ) on a C . I . F . offer . Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request . __eou__  I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account . __eou__
 I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account . __eou__  Quite right . According to the usual practice in international trade , special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them . __eou__
 Quite right . According to the usual practice in international trade , special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them . __eou__  Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ? __eou__
 It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . __eou__  Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? __eou__
 Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . __eou__  Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . __eou__
 Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . __eou__  The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . __eou__

They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . __eou__
 As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . __eou__  I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . __eou__

We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . __eou__

 We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . __eou__  That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . __eou__
 Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . __eou__  Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . __eou__
 It's 1 Australian dollar to 6.1 Yuan RIB . __eou__  What was the rate yesterday ? __eou__
 The rate was 1 Australia dollar to 6.5 Yuan yesterday . __eou__  Oh , the rate goes down . __eou__
 Oh , the rate goes down . __eou__  It does , sir . Do you still want to have it changed now ? __eou__
 Let me think ... Will the rate still go down tomorrow ? __eou__  I don't know , sir . But it won't change much . __eou__
 I don't know , sir . But it won't change much . __eou__  Well , I want to change 1000 Australian dollars for RIB . __eou__
 Here is the 6,100 RIB . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . __eou__  If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . __eou__
 If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . __eou__  I will think about it . __eou__
 I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . __eou__  Wow , you sound very professional . __eou__
 Wow , you sound very professional . __eou__  I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . __eou__
 I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . __eou__  All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation . __eou__
 We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits . __eou__  Well , we ’ re really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want . __eou__
I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price . __eou__  I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . __eou__

This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . __eou__  I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . __eou__
 No . These terms need to be amplified . __eou__  What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ? __eou__
 Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms . __eou__  Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade . __eou__
 Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade . __eou__  Yes , that's very important . __eou__
 By the coming September . __eou__  Could you make an offer on FOB basis ? __eou__
 We have made a lot of improvement in packing . You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom . I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done . __eou__  Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ? __eou__
 We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__  Wonderful . __eou__
 In April or early May . __eou__  I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing . __eou__

The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing . __eou__  In that case , we will have to improve one month further on the time . Now is Jan . If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March , only 2 months are left . The time is too limited . __eou__
 In that case , we will have to improve one month further on the time . Now is Jan . If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March , only 2 months are left . The time is too limited . __eou__  You understand a timely delivery is very important to us . __eou__
 You understand a timely delivery is very important to us . __eou__  All right . You can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment . The fertilizers will be delivered before April . __eou__
I am afraid I have some bad news for you . It's about our order contract O5TSWAL . __eou__  What's the problem ? __eou__
 The goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . What's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged . __eou__  Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . __eou__
 Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . __eou__  But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . __eou__
 But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . __eou__  That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling . __eou__
 That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling . __eou__  But our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing . __eou__
 But our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing . __eou__  But there is nothing wrong with our packing . Our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps . __eou__
 But there is nothing wrong with our packing . Our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps . __eou__  But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . When they were rehandled , some of them were broken . __eou__
 But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . When they were rehandled , some of them were broken . __eou__  I don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care . __eou__
 Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products . __eou__  I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product . __eou__
 I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product . __eou__  To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price . __eou__
 To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price . __eou__  Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc . __eou__
 I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . __eou__  In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . __eou__
Welcome to China , Mr . White . __eou__  How do you do , Ms . Chi ? __eou__
 We normally export CFR . __eou__  What commission do you usually pay for your exports ? As you know , we import on commission basis . __eou__
 That can be discussed . __eou__  All right . When can we meet again for more specific details , Ms Chi ? __eou__
 At sight of course . __eou__  Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . __eou__
If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point on wich we differ . __eou__  That's right . Let's go into the details . __eou__
 But in the United States the Christmas season begins about a month before Dec . 25 . __eou__  Well . I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__
 As new orders keep pouring in , the workers are working three shifts to step up production . __eou__  If that's the case , there is nothing more to be said . __eou__
 If that's the case , there is nothing more to be said . __eou__  I am sorry . __eou__
 I am sorry . __eou__  What's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__
 Sounds like a good idea . __eou__  We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug . __eou__
 Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business . __eou__  Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . __eou__
 Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__  Well . As you understand , the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee . We always ask for L / C for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by L / C for our imports . We only accept L / C for regular orders . __eou__
 It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment . __eou__  How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? __eou__
 Four . They are Loco invoice , FOB invoice , CIF invoice and Franco invoice . __eou__  What does the price in different kinds of invoices include ? __eou__
 By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination . __eou__  Oh , I see . __eou__
 Well , no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay . __eou__  You have children now . What if something , god forbid , happens to you ? __eou__
 Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good . __eou__  Yeah , I lost money investing in the internet too . __eou__
 Yeah , I lost money investing in the internet too . __eou__  Just goes to show that you should buy companies not ideas . __eou__
 Just goes to show that you should buy companies not ideas . __eou__  I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now . __eou__
 I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now . __eou__  Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Ted ? __eou__
 He lost his kids ’ college money by trading . __eou__  Oh , boy . His wife can't be happy about that . __eou__
 Adam Smith . __eou__  Alright , what's your address ? __eou__
 56 Edison Ave , Apartment 39 , Los Angeles . __eou__  When would you like your account closed ? __eou__
 Of course , here you are . These are Black tea from Anti , Oolong tea from Guangdong , Oolong tea from Fujisan and Longing tea from Xinu . The new products are Curls Black tea , Crushed Black tea and so on . They are the best sellers in many countries . __eou__  Oh , such a variety . All of them are excellent both in color and flavour . No wonder our people like China ’ s tea better than any other kind . Could you give me some idea of the prices ? __eou__
 Yes . I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti , 200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea , first grade . __eou__  Good . We will make the offer tomorrow afternoon . Is that all right ? __eou__
 My name is Jenny Clinton . __eou__  I see . Wait for a moment please . I am sorry , Mrs . Clinton , but the remittance doesn't appear to have arrived yet . __eou__
 I see . Wait for a moment please . I am sorry , Mrs . Clinton , but the remittance doesn't appear to have arrived yet . __eou__  Really ? It should have arrived . It was sent a week ago . __eou__
 If the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . But if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week . __eou__  Well , then I'll come again the day after tomorrow . __eou__
 Well , then I'll come again the day after tomorrow . __eou__  Or would you like us to phone you when the money arrives ? __eou__
 The phone number is 328 6765 extension 105 . __eou__  Thank you . We'll inform you in time . Goodbye . __eou__
 It's 7.2 % , fixed-rate loan . __eou__  How do I go about taking it out ? __eou__
 Emily Smith . __eou__  Here is your balance . __eou__
 I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country . __eou__  Do you have an account with this bank ? __eou__
 I'm afraid not . __eou__  In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application . __eou__
 The annual charge rate is 9.5 % . __eou__  That's very expensive ! __eou__
 That's very expensive ! __eou__  Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe . __eou__
 Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe . __eou__  How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? __eou__
 You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . __eou__  Does the card provide any other benefits ? __eou__
 I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . __eou__  Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . __eou__
 Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . __eou__  You mean there is really not that much of a difference . __eou__
 You mean there is really not that much of a difference . __eou__  No , madam . Not very much . __eou__
 No , madam . Not very much . __eou__  Well , may I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? I think that will be enough . __eou__
 Well , not fully automated . __eou__  I see . How do you control the quality ? __eou__
 All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process . __eou__  What ’ s the monthly output ? __eou__
 One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October . __eou__  What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ? __eou__
 About 2 % in normal operations . __eou__  That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ? __eou__
 It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . __eou__  It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? __eou__
 In the early 70s . We ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . __eou__  Congratulations ! __eou__
 Congratulations ! __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  How many employees do you have in this plant ? __eou__
 500 . We ’ re running on three shifts . __eou__  Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? __eou__
 Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? __eou__  That ’ s fine . __eou__
It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range . __eou__  It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ? __eou__
 Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . __eou__  That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . __eou__
 That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . __eou__  The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . __eou__
 The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . __eou__  Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . __eou__
 Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . __eou__  Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . __eou__
I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . __eou__  Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . __eou__
 Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . __eou__  You've had a good trip , I hope . __eou__
 You've had a good trip , I hope . __eou__  Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . __eou__
 Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . __eou__  It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . __eou__
 It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . __eou__  So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . __eou__
 I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__  Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__
 Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__
 But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__  That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? __eou__
 500 pieces . __eou__  No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . __eou__
 I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . __eou__  We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__
 Good , that's all then . __eou__  Good . __eou__
 Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . __eou__  Do you keep a stock of these things ? __eou__
 In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . __eou__  That is , your commission . __eou__
 That is , your commission . __eou__  Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__
 Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__  Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . __eou__
 Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . __eou__  The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__

A 10 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__  According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? __eou__
 Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . __eou__  Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . __eou__
 Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . __eou__  Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . __eou__
 What is it ? __eou__  My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . __eou__
 My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . __eou__  Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade . __eou__
 Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade . __eou__  I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? __eou__
 Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words . __eou__  Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ? __eou__
First of all , I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us . __eou__  We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face . __eou__
 We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face . __eou__  I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . __eou__
 I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . __eou__  We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too . __eou__
 We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too . __eou__  I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it . __eou__
 I'll come to that . My proposal is __eou__  As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? __eou__
 We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . __eou__  That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ? __eou__
 Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . __eou__  Is that including tax ? __eou__
 No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . __eou__  How much is your profit margin then ? __eou__
I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . __eou__  Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now . __eou__
 I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . __eou__  I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . __eou__
 I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . __eou__  We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? __eou__
 So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . __eou__  The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? __eou__
 It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? __eou__  I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! __eou__
 Not too good , I'm sorry . __eou__  I lost ? __eou__
 It was close.To be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner . __eou__  So the price was good ? __eou__
 Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . __eou__  So I didn't miss by much then . __eou__
 So I didn't miss by much then . __eou__  No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time . __eou__
 No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time . __eou__  I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me . __eou__
 I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me . __eou__  That's possible , Bill.But the price would have to have been a lot lower , like around fifty cents per unit . __eou__
 I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days . __eou__  I'm afraid I can't wait that long . Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ? __eou__
 Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . __eou__  Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ? __eou__
 Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you . __eou__  So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ? __eou__
 Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ? __eou__  Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR . __eou__
 Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR . __eou__  Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift . __eou__
 Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift . __eou__  Or a curse . __eou__
 Or a curse . __eou__  Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time . __eou__
Hello , come in , I've been waiting for you . __eou__  Than you , I'm not late , am I ? __eou__
 No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . __eou__  Well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . __eou__
 Well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . __eou__  Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? __eou__
 Please , I wish you would . __eou__  Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . __eou__
 Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . __eou__  Yes , I know that . It's why Ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . I hear you're a good man to do business with . __eou__
 Yes , I know that . It's why Ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . I hear you're a good man to do business with . __eou__  I'm very old-fashioned . I believe in loyalty.Once I start a sales relationship with someone , I stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . I expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle.But if I find out they screwed me over , then I find another supplier . __eou__

 That's pretty much what I heard . __eou__  Well , those are my terms . As long as you honor them , we do business.If you break faith and try to take advantage , I'll find someone else to work with . Can you live with that ? __eou__
Sandrawu Chunk International . __eou__  Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? __eou__
 Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . __eou__  No problem . I'll wait for your call . __eou__
 No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . __eou__  It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? __eou__
 A company account . I need to pay a bill . __eou__  Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . __eou__
 I have all the information in this folder . __eou__  Well . You ’ Ve come prepared . I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . __eou__
I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! __eou__  No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__
 Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . __eou__  Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? __eou__
 Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . __eou__  Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production __eou__
 Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production __eou__  That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__
 Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__  Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__
 I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . __eou__  Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? __eou__
 It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . __eou__  Ah , get back to you . __eou__
 But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... __eou__  It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... __eou__
 It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... __eou__  How much do you think it would cost ? __eou__
We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . __eou__  Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... __eou__
 Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... __eou__  Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? __eou__
That was a beautiful car . It ’ s a new car , but it ’ s totaled . __eou__  Well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . So you don ’ t need to worry . __eou__
 Well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . So you don ’ t need to worry . __eou__  I don ’ t think I could afford that kind of car again . I think I ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace . __eou__
 I don ’ t think I could afford that kind of car again . I think I ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace . __eou__  Since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same . __eou__
 Since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same . __eou__  What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ? __eou__
 China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation __eou__  We found your samples very attractive.We ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable __eou__
 We found your samples very attractive.We ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable __eou__  Our products are of good quality.Since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent.If you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent __eou__
 Our products are of good quality.Since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent.If you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent __eou__  Can I have a reduction of seven percent ? __eou__
 It depends on how much you order __eou__  Can I use the FAS terms ? __eou__
 But we may not get another partner . __eou__  Even so , we can't do business with him.he ' s not reliable . __eou__
 We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__  I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ? __eou__
 We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know , so we can have the funds put aside . __eou__  I'm really busy right now . I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ? __eou__
 Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to . __eou__  Well , I can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ? __eou__
 Yeah , I'm afraid so . I really need your help here . __eou__  Well , just because it's you . Tomorrow , say around noon . __eou__
 Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . __eou__  Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . __eou__
 As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . __eou__  Carton ? __eou__
 Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__  Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__
 I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . __eou__  Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . __eou__
 Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . __eou__  All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . __eou__
 That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . __eou__  Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . __eou__
 Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . __eou__  No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? __eou__
 No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? __eou__  Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . __eou__
 Many of our business friends in England , France , Switzerland , Italy and Germany are paying for our exports in Japan currency . It is quite easy to do so . __eou__  I know some of them are doing that . But this is new to me . I've never made payment in yen before . It is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but I may have some difficulty in making payment in yen . __eou__
 I know some of them are doing that . But this is new to me . I've never made payment in yen before . It is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but I may have some difficulty in making payment in yen . __eou__  Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen . They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service . __eou__
 A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__  Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__
 Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . __eou__  When will that be ? __eou__
 That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation . __eou__  Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future . __eou__
 If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner . __eou__  Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . __eou__  Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . __eou__
 Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . __eou__  That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . __eou__
 These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing __eou__  Oh , the packing looks very nice . __eou__
 Oh , the packing looks very nice . __eou__  The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . __eou__
 The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . __eou__  Good , what about the export packing ? __eou__
 Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . __eou__  Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . __eou__
 You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . __eou__  I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? __eou__
 Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . __eou__  Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . __eou__
That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . __eou__  Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? __eou__
 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . __eou__  Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . __eou__
 Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . __eou__  Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . __eou__
 Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . __eou__  Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? __eou__
 Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . __eou__  That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . __eou__
 That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . __eou__  I should say it is something we have never come across before . __eou__
 I should say it is something we have never come across before . __eou__  The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . __eou__
 The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . __eou__  In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . __eou__
 In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . __eou__  Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . __eou__
 Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . __eou__  Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? __eou__
 Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? __eou__  I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . __eou__
 I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . __eou__  In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? __eou__
 Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__  What about the outer packing ? __eou__
 We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . __eou__  Cartons ? __eou__
 Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__  Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__
 I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . __eou__  The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . __eou__
 The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . __eou__  Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . __eou__
 I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . __eou__  We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . __eou__
 I understand . __eou__  Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . __eou__
 That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . __eou__  You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . __eou__
 You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . __eou__  But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us . __eou__
Well , that was an interesting documentary ! __eou__  For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . __eou__
 For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . __eou__  Like what ? __eou__
 Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? __eou__  Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__
 Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__  That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__
 That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__  That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__
 Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__  I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! __eou__
It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods . __eou__  And that is ? __eou__
 It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . __eou__  I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? __eou__
 Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . __eou__  Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . __eou__
 Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__  I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__
 It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__  It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__
 It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__  That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__
 That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__  You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! __eou__
 I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . __eou__  Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . __eou__
 Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . __eou__  In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? __eou__
 It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . __eou__  Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? __eou__
 If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . __eou__  It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . __eou__
 It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . __eou__  We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . __eou__
 We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . __eou__  If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . __eou__
 First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook . __eou__  Is there any minimum for the first deposit ? __eou__
 It varies from time to time . At present it is 6 % . __eou__  By the way , can I open a checking account too ? __eou__
 Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars . __eou__  I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money . __eou__
 Well , in that case , I think a checking account may be more convenient for you . However , there's a service charge . __eou__  How much is the service charge ? __eou__
 One percent . __eou__  Sounds reasonable . Will 300 dollars be enough for a minimal deposit ? __eou__
 I want 100 pounds . And here are 189 U . S . dollars . __eou__  ... OK . And here's your money . __eou__
 Thank you . And goodbye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
 It is 3.2 % . You may earn a little interest on money . __eou__  Is there any minimum deposit for the first time ? __eou__
 Yes , the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 Yuan . __eou__  What about the later deposits ? __eou__
 For the later deposits , you can deposit any you want . Even one Yuan is OK . __eou__  OK , that's good . __eou__
 OK , that's good . __eou__  Your ID , please . __eou__
 Besides the checking account , there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account . __eou__  Oh , I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then . __eou__
 All right . And here's your deposit book . __eou__  Thank you . Goodbye . __eou__
 Thank you . Goodbye . __eou__  Goodbye . __eou__
 Twenties would be fine . __eou__  Do you want the whole amount in traveler's check ? __eou__
 Well , it's listed on the electronic board on the left . We cash it at present traveler's check buying rate . __eou__  Oh , I see . How much it the service charge ? __eou__
 The service charge is 1 % of the total amount of the check . __eou__  Well , I'd like to cash these four checks for $ 100 each . __eou__
 One thousand U . S . dollars . __eou__  One thousand U . S . Mm hmm . And are you going to pay cash ? __eou__
 It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % . __eou__  By the way , can I open a checking account too ? __eou__
 $ 200 altogether . __eou__  Would you mind showing me your passport ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 One US Dollars in cash is equivalent t0 7.9 Yuan . __eou__  And I want to change 4000 Yuan . __eou__
 The rate is still high for other foreign currencies . The exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars into Renminbi is 1.053 Renminbi yuan to one dollar . __eou__  Oh , I see . Could you please split the one thousand Renminbi into hundreds and tens ? __eou__
 In tens and fifties , please . __eou__  Here you are . Please sign your name here . __eou__
 You see , if you press this red button , the helmet becomes an umbrella . __eou__  How amazing ! I have never seen it before . Is it expensive ? __eou__
 It only costs you 20 dollars for one . __eou__  OK , I will take one . __eou__
 Absolutely . I've sorted out all the materials we need and sifted three great ways of marketing . __eou__  Oh , that's good . __eou__
 Oh , that's good . __eou__  We can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products . __eou__
 We can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products . __eou__  It seems you've got everything done . Now I can finally stop worrying about it and get back to work . __eou__
 I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . __eou__  Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__
 I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__  Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__
 Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__  That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__  Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__
 Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__  I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__
 I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__  I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__
 I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__  That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . __eou__
 Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary . __eou__  Which is the best way ? __eou__
 $ 800 . __eou__  Why don't you send it by mail payment order ? __eou__
 About a week . __eou__  I don't know . Can I send it more quickly ? __eou__
 Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank . __eou__  I see . How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer ? __eou__
 It's easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . __eou__  Oh yes . I've got it written down here . Just a minute . __eou__
 1.15 U . S . dollars to the euro . __eou__  Okay . I'd like to change some euro into US dollars , please . __eou__
 Six hundred euro . __eou__  Very good . May I see your passport ? __eou__
 I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary . __eou__  Can you tell me why you want to buy it ? __eou__
 Yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . __eou__  That's very convenient . __eou__
 That's very convenient . __eou__  It is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? __eou__
 The maximum is $ 1000 . __eou__  Is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? __eou__
 Yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . __eou__  That's true . Is everything alright with my documents ? __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 Let me see . The offering price is near or at $ 88 . __eou__  Then the difference between the asking price and the offering price is $ 2 . It's hard to take place today . __eou__
 Then the difference between the asking price and the offering price is $ 2 . It's hard to take place today . __eou__  Do you mean that I have to buy it at current price ? __eou__
 You can decide by yourself . __eou__  I heard that this stock would go up . Hum , I will take it at current price . __eou__
 According to today's exchange rate , every US dollar in cash is equivalent to 0.75 euros . __eou__  Is there any service charge ? __eou__
 No , I don't . I don't have a family , so I don't think I need it . __eou__  This year our company is offering a new plan especially for single people like you . I think you might be interested . __eou__
Good morning , madam . __eou__  Good morning . __eou__
 Good morning . __eou__  May I help you ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
The NASDAQ gained a few points today . __eou__  Does it mean anything ? __eou__
 It's hard to say . The stock market is weird . You never know what will happen tomorrow . __eou__  Why do you buy stocks , then ? __eou__
Good afternoon , Mr . Anderson . __eou__  Good afternoon , Miss Li . __eou__
 Good afternoon , Miss Li . __eou__  How nice to see you again ! __eou__
 How nice to see you again ! __eou__  Nice to see you , too . __eou__
 Nice to see you , too . __eou__  It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How are you ? __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Jones . __eou__  Hello , Miss Wu . __eou__
 Hello , Miss Wu . __eou__  Long time no see . How is everything at home ? __eou__
 Let me see them . Yes , they ’ re OK . __eou__  What ’ s the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ? __eou__
 You can deposit an initial amount of five dollars . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Let me see . I think maybe 600 USD at least . __eou__  Pardon ? __eou__
 Six hundred US dollars . __eou__  I'm sorry , sir , after 7 __eou__
 You can deposit an initial amount of ten dollars . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 A thousand dollars . __eou__  Let me check with our credit manager . ( later ) Our record shows that your credit rating is quite high . I don't think you'll have any problems . __eou__
 Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest . __eou__  Why is that ? __eou__
 It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account . __eou__  I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ? __eou__
 10 o'clock in the morning to 2 o'clock in the afternoon . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 In 50 Yuan or 100 Yuan would be fine . __eou__  Here's the cash for you . __eou__
 Here's the cash for you . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 Three thousand US dollars . __eou__  All right , can I have your passbook ? __eou__
 It's all the same to me . __eou__  Here you are . __eou__
 Here you are . __eou__  Thanks . __eou__
 In ten dollar bill , please . __eou__  Is there anything else ? __eou__
Mister , I have an account now . __eou__  Now , how would you like this check cashed , madam ? __eou__
 I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me . __eou__  Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ? __eou__
Bill , I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival . But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price , for my business is fairly new . I hope that you can make me an advance on loan . __eou__  Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security ? __eou__
 No . I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation . You may inspect my accounts . From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations . __eou__  We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security . This is a common regulation . But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor . __eou__
 The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC . __eou__  I plan to take the loan for 3 years . __eou__
 Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank . __eou__  That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much . __eou__
 That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much . __eou__  You're welcome . __eou__
 It's US 100 for RIB 802 today . __eou__  I'd like to exchange 3,000 . __eou__

 Well , here's 3,000 yuan . __eou__  Please write down your name , address and the amount of your deposit here . And please choose a passcode of six numbers and confirm it . __eou__

 Our systems are 100 % trouble-free . __eou__  How do you ensure quality ? __eou__
 Any of our new products shall go through a 1-3 month testing period . __eou__  Are your prices negotiable ? __eou__
 Your satisfaction is guaranteed , or we refund your money . __eou__  I see . But I have to discuss it over with my boss before I make a decision . __eou__
 I believe your corporation will try your best and I understand fully your feeling , if your tender conditions proved be suitable for our general conditions of tender , we will accept your submission of tender . __eou__  Maybe I have asking too many questions today . __eou__
 Maybe I have asking too many questions today . __eou__  That's all right . You can contact me later if you have other questions after you read the tender notice . __eou__
 Interest is paid at the rate of 1 % per annum at present . And it is added to your account every year . __eou__  Thank you very much . __eou__
 Thank you very much . __eou__  My pleasure . __eou__
 Yes ! Here is my bankbook . __eou__  OK . Please fill out this form first . __eou__
 Thanks a lot . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Just a mistake with my name . It should be issued as Steven , but the card is under the name ' Steven ' . __eou__  Oh , I am very sorry about that . It's our fault . I will arrange someone to correct it immediately . __eou__
 OK , no problem . To err is human . __eou__  Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed . __eou__
 This rate is one percent . That will be 10 yuan . __eou__  OK . When will this remittance arrive ? __eou__
 Generally it will arrive within three days . __eou__  That's good . __eou__
 Room 20 , Suzie Building , Beijing Road , Shenzhen , China . __eou__  Ok , that's all . __eou__
 O . K . We offer a few different kinds . __eou__  I want the one with the highest interest rate . __eou__
 You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % . __eou__  All right . I ’ ll open one of those . __eou__
 Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good . __eou__  Yeah . I lost money investing in the Internet , too . __eou__
 Yeah . I lost money investing in the Internet , too . __eou__  Just goes to show that you should buy companies , not ideas . __eou__
 I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now . __eou__  Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Frank ? __eou__
 He lost his kids ' college money day trading . __eou__  Oh , boy . His wife can ’ t be happy about that . __eou__
 Well , no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay . __eou__  You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ? __eou__
I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . __eou__  It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ? __eou__
 It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . __eou__  It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way . __eou__
 I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . __eou__  Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ? __eou__
Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . __eou__  Yeah , the government really takes a bite , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__
 Yeah , the government really takes a bite , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__  Seriously . The only tax I don ’ t mind them taking is social security . It ’ s only a few dollars every paycheck . __eou__
 Seriously . The only tax I don ’ t mind them taking is social security . It ’ s only a few dollars every paycheck . __eou__  Yeah , I don ’ t mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? __eou__
 Yeah . It won ’ t be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . __eou__  Yeah . My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . __eou__
 Yeah . My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . __eou__  Let ’ s just hope the politicians don ’ t figure out a way to spend it . __eou__
 Let ’ s just hope the politicians don ’ t figure out a way to spend it . __eou__  Really ? No , they couldn ’ t . None of them would have jobs if they did . __eou__
 yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . __eou__  I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! __eou__
 I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! __eou__  thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . __eou__

 so by then , you'll be in charge of the whole department . __eou__  absolutely . __eou__
 Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars . __eou__  I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money . __eou__
During the last two years , there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad . __eou__  If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same . __eou__
 If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same . __eou__  If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition , the steamship company doesn ’ t have liability for pilferage . How do we protect ourselves ? __eou__
 The insurance policy protects us . __eou__  Is it true that products of high value such as watches , jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage ? __eou__
I'm calling today about a bill that I never received . __eou__  Can you tell me which credit card it was for ? __eou__

 The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed . __eou__  What am I supposed to do about my bill then ? __eou__
 The price quoted is for CIF . __eou__  My understanding is that CIF means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy . __eou__
 My understanding is that CIF means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy . __eou__  Yes , that is correct . We will arrange for the shipping costs and insurance policy . __eou__
 Yes , that is correct . We will arrange for the shipping costs and insurance policy . __eou__  Is it possible to consider FOB ? That way , we will handle the insurance through our broker . __eou__

 It was supposed to be for $ 100 . __eou__  I ’ ll cancel that check for you . __eou__

 The check was written for $ 150 . __eou__  How much were you supposed to write it for ? __eou__
 I needed to write it for $ 100 . __eou__  I can cancel it for you right now . __eou__
 I have a problem with this check . __eou__  What ’ s wrong ? __eou__
 I wrote out a check for $ 100 and it bounced . __eou__  Do you have enough money in your checking account ? __eou__
 I believe so . __eou__  Give me a moment , and I ’ ll check . __eou__

 The charge was for a $ 350 purse , but I did not buy it . __eou__  Are you sure that you didn't make that purchase ? __eou__

 It was bought on November 12th at 3 __eou__  All right , we'll do an investigation . __eou__
 All right , we'll do an investigation . __eou__  Until this investigation is finished , will I have to pay for the charge ? __eou__
 I have a problem . __eou__  What ’ s the problem ? __eou__
 Someone else is making charges on my debit card . __eou__  I need to see a statement for your debit card . __eou__
 The last four charges . __eou__  We will need to do an investigation on this . __eou__
I have a problem with my credit card . __eou__  What's wrong with it ? __eou__
 There is a charge on my card that I didn't make . __eou__  Can you tell me what the charge was ? __eou__
 It's for a purse that cost $ 350 . __eou__  Are you positive that you didn't buy the purse ? __eou__
 I can't even afford a purse that expensive . __eou__  I'm very sorry . When was this purchase made ? __eou__
 I was at work , but the purchase was made at 3 __eou__  We're going to investigate this claim . __eou__
 I have a problem . __eou__  What ’ s your problem ? __eou__
 I owe fees , but a bank statement never came in the mail about it . __eou__  I apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__
 I apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__  I have no idea about the fee , so my fees went up . __eou__
 I have no idea about the fee , so my fees went up . __eou__  I understand your problem . __eou__
 I understand your problem . __eou__  Will you be able to solve my problem ? __eou__
 I ’ m having a problem . __eou__  What is it ? __eou__
 I apparently owe some fees , but I never got the bank statement . __eou__  I do apologize for that . __eou__
 I do apologize for that . __eou__  My fees went up , but I didn ’ t even know I had fees to pay . __eou__
 My fees went up , but I didn ’ t even know I had fees to pay . __eou__  I see your problem . __eou__
 I see your problem . __eou__  What are you going to do about it ? __eou__
 I will cancel the fees you owe . __eou__  I don ’ t have to pay any fees ? __eou__
 What's the problem ? __eou__  There is a charge on here that I never made . __eou__
 There is a charge on here that I never made . __eou__  What charge was made ? __eou__
 It was a charge for a $ 350 purse that I never bought . __eou__  You didn't make this purchase ? __eou__
 I think I would remember if I made a purchase that large . __eou__  Sorry . When was this purse purchased ? __eou__
 It was purchased on the 12th of November at 3 __eou__  We'll do an investigation and get to the bottom of this . __eou__
 I want to know about fees . __eou__  Which fees ? __eou__
 Overdraft fees . __eou__  You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft . __eou__
 You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft . __eou__  How much is the fee ? __eou__
 It should stop you from overdrafting . __eou__  You would think it would , but it most likely won ’ t . __eou__
 You would think it would , but it most likely won ’ t . __eou__  Can I help you with anything else ? __eou__
 I ’ m great . Thanks . __eou__  What do you need ? __eou__
 Actually , you do owe some fees . __eou__  How much do I owe ? __eou__
 Your fees total $ 235.13 . __eou__  That ’ s crazy ! __eou__
 That ’ s crazy ! __eou__  You need to pay these fees soon . __eou__
 I ’ m great . Thank you for asking . __eou__  What can I do for you ? __eou__
 You sure do . __eou__  Could you tell me how much I owe ? __eou__
 You owe $ 235.13 in fees . __eou__  I can ’ t believe that . __eou__
 I can ’ t believe that . __eou__  When will you be paying these fees off ? __eou__
 Very well . Thank you . __eou__  What can I help you with ? __eou__
 As a matter of fact , you do . __eou__  How much ? __eou__
 You owe $ 235.13 . __eou__  That ’ s unbelievable . __eou__
 That ’ s unbelievable . __eou__  Will you be paying some of that off today ? __eou__
 That ’ s the least amount you can have . __eou__  What ’ ll happen if I don ’ t maintain that ? __eou__
 We will fine you . __eou__  How much will I be fined ? __eou__
 Yes . That ’ s the minimum . __eou__  What happens if I don ’ t meet that requirement ? __eou__
 I have another savings account open already . __eou__  Do you want to transfer money from that account ? __eou__
 I ’ m fine . Thank you . __eou__  How may I help you ? __eou__
 It ’ s going to be $ 300 . __eou__  What account would you like to deposit that into ? __eou__
 Yes , really . __eou__  What if I can ’ t meet that requirement ? __eou__
 You will be fined . __eou__  How much is the fine ? __eou__
 The fee is $ 25 every time you overdraft . __eou__  How is that a small fee ? __eou__
 That fee should keep you from overdrafting . __eou__  I ’ ll say . __eou__
 I ’ ll say . __eou__  Do you have any more questions ? __eou__
 For each time you overdraft , you have to pay $ 25 . __eou__  That ’ s not a small fee . __eou__
 That ’ s not a small fee . __eou__  You shouldn ’ t overdraft . __eou__
 You shouldn ’ t overdraft . __eou__  That ’ s for sure . __eou__
 That ’ s for sure . __eou__  Do you need help with anything else ? __eou__
You owe $ 36.78 . __eou__  Here ’ s my VISA card . __eou__
 Here ’ s my VISA card . __eou__  I ’ m sorry , but your card isn ’ t working . __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , but your card isn ’ t working . __eou__  What ’ s the problem ? __eou__
 The machine says your card was declined . __eou__  It was ? __eou__
 I guess you won ’ t be able to purchase these items today . __eou__  I ’ ll come tomorrow with cash . __eou__
 I have never used an ATM before . __eou__  I can show you how to use it . __eou__
The total for all these items comes to $ 36.78 . __eou__  Take my VISA . __eou__
 There is something wrong with your card . __eou__  What ’ s going on ? __eou__
 Your card was declined . __eou__  That can ’ t be right ! __eou__
 That can ’ t be right ! __eou__  Would you like me to try another card ? __eou__
 I ’ m sorry , but you can ’ t take the items until you can buy them . __eou__  I ’ ll come back for them tomorrow . __eou__
Your total comes to $ 36.78 . __eou__  Put it on my VISA . __eou__
 There ’ s a problem with your card . __eou__  What ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__
 I believe it was declined . __eou__  You ’ re kidding me ! __eou__
 You ’ re not going to be able to take these items today . __eou__  I ’ ll be back tomorrow . __eou__
 This will be my first time using an ATM . __eou__  I can help you with that . __eou__
 I ’ m not sure how . __eou__  I don ’ t understand . __eou__
 I don ’ t understand . __eou__  I ’ Ve never used one before . __eou__
 I ’ Ve never used one before . __eou__  I can help you figure it out . __eou__
 I don ’ t need it anymore . __eou__  What would you like to do with all the money in this account ? __eou__
 That would be great . __eou__  Do you want to take any money out ? __eou__
 I only need one . __eou__  What about all your money in that account ? __eou__
 I appreciate it . __eou__  Would you like to make a withdrawal ? __eou__
 Oh ... wait a minute ... here ’ s my driver ’ s license . __eou__  OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service __eou__
 I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money form once currency t __eou__  Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__
 I sometimes use traveller's cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__  Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__
 Yes , I do . It saves me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__  That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__  Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__
 Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__  I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__
 I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__  I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__
 I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__  That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . __eou__
 Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . __eou__  I took out a life insurance policy and made my wife the beneficiary . __eou__
 I took out a life insurance policy and made my wife the beneficiary . __eou__  That ’ a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be dangerous job . __eou__
 That ’ a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be dangerous job . __eou__  I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . __eou__
 I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . __eou__  I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . __eou__
 I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . __eou__  That ’ s one of the conditions of my police too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . __eou__
 That ’ s one of the conditions of my police too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . __eou__  Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the police ? __eou__
 It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . __eou__  Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . __eou__
 Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . __eou__  I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? __eou__
 You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . __eou__  But what if I need my money suddenly ? __eou__
 The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . __eou__  Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! __eou__
 Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! __eou__  Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot __eou__
 Ten percent ! Now that ’ s hefty ! __eou__  Wait a minute ... do you have an account with us ? __eou__
 Yes I do; here is my account number . __eou__  For members , there is a small transaction charge , but it ’ s only 5 dollars per transaction . Any particular denomination ? __eou__
 I will be leaving the city soon so I have no need for this account . __eou__  I see . Well for this amount I will have to get my manager ’ s approval . __eou__
Good morning , miss . __eou__  Good morning , sir . __eou__
 Good morning , sir . __eou__  Could you tell me please where can I find a currents exchange ? __eou__
 Yes , here is my account number . __eou__  May i please see ID ? __eou__
 900 dollars . __eou__  How would you like it ? __eou__
 Thank you , have a nice day . __eou__  Thank you , have a good day . __eou__
 It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam . __eou__  Why ? What happened ? __eou__
 Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s . __eou__  Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . __eou__
 Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . __eou__  Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . __eou__
 Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . __eou__  Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . __eou__
 I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . __eou__  Not in a million years ! __eou__
 Pete ! Nice to see you Well , on top the norm , you know , wife and kids and work , I ’ Ve actually gotten into doing some trading . __eou__  Trading ? You , big guy ? What are you trading ? __eou__
 Currencies . __eou__  Currencies ? As in Euros , Dollars , Pounds and Rupees ? __eou__
 It ’ s called Forex . Foreign Exchange . The great thing about it is that I don ’ t have to invest a huge amount . I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much ! __eou__  I don ’ t understand . You ’ re buying and selling money ? __eou__
 You got it ! Just last night I made USD 150 ! __eou__  Last night ? __eou__
 Yeah ! It ’ s a 24 hour market ! I had bought some RIB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RIB at an amazing bid ! I ’ __eou__  You ’ re kidding ! I ’ m on ! Where do I sign up ? __eou__
Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news . __eou__  What is it ? __eou__
 Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money ! __eou__  What do you mean ? What happened ? __eou__
 There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . __eou__  How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! __eou__
 How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! __eou__  I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . __eou__
 I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . __eou__  Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company ! __eou__
 there ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money form the ATM . __eou__  I have to exchange some money . __eou__
 I have to exchange some money . __eou__  that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . __eou__
 that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . __eou__  I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . __eou__
 I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . __eou__  I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . __eou__
 I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . __eou__  their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . __eou__
Well , that was an interesting documentary ! __eou__  For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . __eou__
 For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . __eou__  Like what ? __eou__
 Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? __eou__  Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__
 Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__  That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__
 That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__  That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__
 Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__  I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! __eou__
 No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . __eou__  It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? __eou__
 Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . __eou__  It ’ s my pleasure . __eou__
 Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__  I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__
 It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__  It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__
 It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__  That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__
 That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__  You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! __eou__
 I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... __eou__  Please input your 6 digit PIN code followed by the pound key . Thank you . Please select an option.Thank you . You have selected withdrawal . __eou__
 For a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 . __eou__  That ’ s a little steep for our company.Do you offer any discounts ? __eou__
 For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 . __eou__  So , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ? That still might be a little hard.Couldn ’ t you discount it further ? We ’ Ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might __eou__
 Our product features inventory tracking software , which continuously updates and tracks your inventory on a real-time basis . __eou__  Is the software user-friendly ? __eou__
 Yes it is very easy to use and each system installation comes with a 3 - day employee training seminar . __eou__  Is this training part of the package or will it cost extra ? __eou__
 Our terms are net 30 . __eou__  What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ? __eou__
 We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units . __eou__  An option we can offer is two separate shipments.We will house the inventory until you are ready for us to ship it to you . __eou__
I ’ m so frustrated ! __eou__  what ’ s wrong , Jim ? __eou__
 I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! __eou__  Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? __eou__
 yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . __eou__  Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ? __eou__
 I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . __eou__  Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? __eou__
 You definitely made the right move by calling . Our primary business is creating , conducting and customizing fully interactive human resources workshops for companies just like yours . __eou__  It seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team . Not to mention serious lapses in service , sales and leadership skills . __eou__
 It seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team . Not to mention serious lapses in service , sales and leadership skills . __eou__  Well as we know nothing comes out of a can . We have years of experience tailoring workshops to the specific needs of your company . We can hone in on your problem areas and have your employe __eou__
 What a relief ! I was beginning to think it was no way to get my business rolling again . __eou__  That's what we're here for , the human resources help you need , when and how you need it . __eou__
 Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . __eou__  Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? __eou__
 As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . __eou__  That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . __eou__
 That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . __eou__  It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . __eou__
 It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . __eou__  So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . __eou__
 So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . __eou__  Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . __eou__
 Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . __eou__  You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised . __eou__
 You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised . __eou__  No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . __eou__
 No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . __eou__  In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra . __eou__
 In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra . __eou__  I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately . __eou__
 I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately . __eou__  Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet . __eou__
 Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet . __eou__  I understand , Ma'am . __eou__
 I understand , Ma'am . __eou__  And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . __eou__
 And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . __eou__  It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . __eou__
 It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . __eou__  I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept . __eou__
You won't believe what just happened . __eou__  What ? __eou__
 I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate . __eou__  Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ? __eou__
 Not today . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . __eou__  Why ? __eou__
 Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . __eou__  Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? __eou__
 I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . __eou__  Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? __eou__
 So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . __eou__  That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ? __eou__
 That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me . __eou__  You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? __eou__
 Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t __eou__  Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? __eou__
 Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? __eou__  Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . __eou__
 Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . __eou__  Well , welcome to the team . __eou__
 Yes . I've read it carefully . __eou__  And do you have any questions ? __eou__
 I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? __eou__  Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? __eou__
 Good . And your benefits will begin immediately . __eou__  Even my health insurance ? __eou__
 Yes . We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.And your free membership in the club starts today if you like . __eou__  I have a few questions about the free membership . __eou__
 Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . __eou__  What are bar vouchers ? __eou__
 Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . __eou__  But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . __eou__
 But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . __eou__  That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do . __eou__
 That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do . __eou__  So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ? __eou__
 Yes . I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms . __eou__  I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it . __eou__
 I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it . __eou__  I'm very pleased . We look forward to having you here , Miss Briggs . __eou__
 Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . __eou__  I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . __eou__
 I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . __eou__  So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? __eou__
 10 o ’ clock in the morning to 2 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__  Thank you . __eou__
 Thank you . __eou__  Not at all . __eou__
 Honestly , the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours . __eou__  Yes , flextime has definitely been a good change for us . How do you feel about the pay ? __eou__
 At first it is going to be difficult . During the first three months , I'm on probation . So I won't get sales commissions until after that . __eou__  But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period . __eou__
 But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period . __eou__  Yes , I'm looking forward to that ! I just hope my first performance review is favorable . __eou__
 Yes , I'm looking forward to that ! I just hope my first performance review is favorable . __eou__  One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review , __eou__
 One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review , __eou__  Great ! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion , too . __eou__
 Yes , furthering my education is already bringing about positive results in my workplace as it has boosted my confidence.As well the tutoring system my school employs offers courses uniquely suite __eou__  Really ? That's great that you found a school that puts your need first . __eou__
 Really ? That's great that you found a school that puts your need first . __eou__  As well my company has been very supportive about my decision.They ' Ve cut back my working hours in order to accommodate my studies . __eou__
 As well my company has been very supportive about my decision.They ' Ve cut back my working hours in order to accommodate my studies . __eou__  That's great . They must really be committed to staff development . __eou__
 That's great . They must really be committed to staff development . __eou__  They are.We definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved . __eou__
 We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained . __eou__  What ’ s the result ? __eou__
 We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received . __eou__  That seems very impressive . Good work ! __eou__
 That seems very impressive . Good work ! __eou__  Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level . __eou__
 Oh . Current account don ’ t pay our interest . __eou__  Why is that ? __eou__
 It ’ s primarily design for business transactions . That is write checks to pay the bills , buying things and sending money . We won ’ t expect a large amount of deposit in current account . __eou__  I see . How do I draw money from my news then . __eou__
Well , we've finally put the finishing touches on the training programs for next year . Here's a report showing the projected costs as well as the expected return on investment . __eou__  Return on investment ? How can you have a return on this kind of investment ? Can you really calculate the value of these training programs ? __eou__
 Sure ! It's not a real figure , of course . It's just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence . __eou__  Wow ! I'm impressed . So , what's in the cards for future training ? Will it be in-house or off-site ? __eou__
 A little of both . We'll have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . Those are available to everyone . We also have a variety of other programs __eou__  Yes , I see that here ... continuing education for the IT department , a time management course for accounting , and team building for sales . Anything planned for HR ? __eou__
Mr . Smith , I have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than I am c __eou__  What are you basing this information on ? __eou__
 I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . __eou__  Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? __eou__
 Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . __eou__  Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . __eou__
 Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . __eou__  That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? __eou__
 Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company . __eou__  And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects . __eou__
 And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects . __eou__  It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me . __eou__
 It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me . __eou__  My feelings are mixed on the issue too . By helping you I ’ m losing a valuable and trusted employee . However I think you are taking a step in the right direction . __eou__
You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results . __eou__  I am glad that you have been happy with my performance . __eou__
 I am glad that you have been happy with my performance . __eou__  As a result of your performance , we are happy to offer you the position of manager . __eou__

 We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . __eou__  It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? __eou__

 that's very convenient . __eou__  it is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? __eou__
 the maximum is $ 1000 . __eou__  is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? __eou__
 yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the amount . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . __eou__  that's true . Is everything alright with my documents ? __eou__
 they're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . __eou__  thank you very much . __eou__
 thank you very much . __eou__  you're welcome . __eou__
 Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . __eou__  Why not ? __eou__
 Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . __eou__  Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . __eou__
 Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . __eou__  That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . __eou__
 That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . __eou__  Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? __eou__

 Well , I was wondering what the salaries are like ? I mean ... are they much lower than the corporate world ? __eou__  Well , I can't speak for all universities , but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans . I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation . __eou__
 Yeah , that's what I thought . But , I've heard that the perks are better . I was wondering if that was really true . __eou__  I'd have to say yes and no on that . I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to . I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that . __eou__

 I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__  I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__

 Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ? __eou__  Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university . __eou__
Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks . __eou__  He spoke evil behind his back . __eou__
 How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? __eou__  Someone told joe off . __eou__
 I've heard that the company is very strict with its staff.Is that true ? __eou__  Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations . __eou__
 If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ? __eou__  No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work . __eou__
 Working here involves a busy schedule and overtime.Is that true ? __eou__  Yes.That ' s true . We are always busy . The company attaches great importance to high efficiency . Sometimes we have to work overtime , but not always . And we have extra pay for extra work . __eou__
Who is on duty ? __eou__  I am , sir . __eou__
What are the requirements to apply for the position ? __eou__  Your major must be computer . __eou__
 Do you think my educational background suits this position ? __eou__  Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications . __eou__
 Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ? __eou__  Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course . __eou__
Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? __eou__  Two . French and Spanish . __eou__
 And how well can you speak them ? __eou__  Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . __eou__
 And how about your Spanish ? __eou__  Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . __eou__
How will you ship the order ? __eou__  Air freight is the quickest and safest way , I think . __eou__
 Where do you see yourself five years from now ? __eou__  I see myself in a management position . __eou__
 It's hard to say . But why ? __eou__  We expect the goods to be on the market before the end of December to catch up with the Spring Festival sales . __eou__

When do you plan to deliver the goods ? __eou__  This weekend . __eou__
May I know how long will it take to get some more in from the factory ? __eou__  About 3 weeks . __eou__
 When will you be able to deliver ? __eou__  By the end of this month , at the latest . __eou__
What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? __eou__  First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__
 I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ .

 Where would you like to be in 5 years ? __eou__  In five years , I ’ d like to be a senior manager of this corporation . __eou__
 How do you plan to accomplish this ? __eou__  By doing whatever is necessary . __eou__
 What would you like to know , Mr . Green ? __eou__  What working experience have you get ? __eou__
 What working experience have you get ? __eou__  In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now . __eou__
 Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ? __eou__  Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here . __eou__
What is your great struck ? __eou__  I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time . __eou__
 Why do you think you be a good fit or this job ? __eou__  Because I ’ m very competent in this area . __eou__

 I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? __eou__  Yes he ' s in his office . __eou__
 You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? __eou__  I think he might . You'd better go to his office . __eou__
 A :: So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years , ready for change ? __eou__  B :: Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges . __eou__
 Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! __eou__  Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! __eou__
How do you think the report I wrote ? __eou__  Not bad . But there is more room for improvement . __eou__
How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ? __eou__  With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired . __eou__
 Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ? __eou__  He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy . __eou__
So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ? __eou__  I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . __eou__
 And how do you like working for IBM ? __eou__  It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot . __eou__

 You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? __eou__  To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . __eou__
How do I submit an expense report ? __eou__  You need all your receipts for reimbursement . __eou__
 You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? __eou__  Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you . __eou__
Are you familiar with the office management ? __eou__  I have done something like that before . __eou__
 Are you still interested in it ? __eou__  I think I am . I left the job only because it was too far from my home . __eou__
Did you sign up for the picnic party ? __eou__  Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . __eou__
 How about your experience ? __eou__  I worked as a PR clerk for one year __eou__
 Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? __eou__  He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . __eou__
 Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? __eou__  Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . __eou__
 How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? __eou__  I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . __eou__
 How ? __eou__  You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . __eou__
Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__  Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__
You look really wiped out ? __eou__  I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . __eou__
Hi , still in the office ? It ’ s already 7 . __eou__  I would like to go but I have to finish a very important presentation . Our boss needs it for tomorrow ’ s morning meeting and I was given the complete information only late this afternoon . __eou__
 Sounds like our boss . Typically him always late with important information . Anything I can help ? __eou__  Oh , that will be great . Thank you so much . Please help me to double-check the name list . I have to make sure they are all correct . __eou__
Hi , Francis , morning ! How are you doing today ? __eou__  I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting . __eou__
 Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ? __eou__  It is ok . My boss briefs me later on . __eou__
 Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ? __eou__  Err , kind of . You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days . __eou__
Did you punch in ? __eou__  Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! __eou__
 Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? __eou__  Sure , when those never ending meetings . __eou__
 What do you need ? __eou__  I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . __eou__
 Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . __eou__  Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . __eou__
What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . __eou__  What do you mean ? __eou__
 What do you mean ? __eou__  Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . __eou__
What is your most preferred training method ? __eou__  Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . __eou__
 Well , that is also very efficient , right ? __eou__  Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . __eou__
Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? __eou__  No , really ? __eou__
 No , really ? __eou__  Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__
 Who will be there ? __eou__  James is going to be packed off there . __eou__
 What ’ s up ? __eou__  Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday . __eou__
 Anything that distracts you from work ? __eou__  Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . __eou__
How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? __eou__  If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . __eou__
How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? __eou__  We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__
 What do you think his strengths are ? __eou__  Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . __eou__
 Have you thought about it seriously ? __eou__  Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . __eou__
 Ok , did you find a new company ? __eou__  Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . __eou__
What is the most enjoyable part about your job ? __eou__  I think meeting people . There are people from all over the country , all over the world , all walks of life which is the most interesting part of my job . __eou__
 What do you find annoying ? __eou__  Well , I work very long hours , ten hours a day is quite normal . And if something important comes up , I ’ m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening . __eou__
Hello , this is Francis from XYZ Company . I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . Do you have time to meet ? __eou__  Well , I am not sure . Lets me check my agenda __eou__
 What is the problem ? __eou__  I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . __eou__
I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . __eou__  Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . __eou__
 Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I've got to be there , right ? __eou__  Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__
 Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one . __eou__  If we were in the same conference room , I would not work late these days . That conference room has been booked out . This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu . __eou__
What sort of job would you like to take ? __eou__  I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator . __eou__
 Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__  Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . __eou__
 It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? __eou__  That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . __eou__
 This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? __eou__  The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__
 You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__  Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__
Do you want to sign for a Korea language class ? __eou__  What for ? Oh , I see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market . __eou__
Which job do you prefer , an accountant or a secretary ? __eou__  Neither , I prefer an active job . __eou__
Is the view going to be ok ? __eou__  Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . __eou__
 How did I do ? __eou__  Not so good . Lots of complains . __eou__
Hi , are you busy ? __eou__  Hi , I was just coming to see you.But since you made the trek to my office , you get to go first . __eou__
 Well , I can try , what do you need ? __eou__  You were there when the problem started . I was hoping you could fill me in on the details . __eou__
 Fine , but before you agree , don't you need to know what you're agreeing to ? __eou__  I guess you're right.But like you said , you called me here to check me out . I've been doing the same . __eou__
 Ha , ha , ha ! That's fair.How did I do ? __eou__  Quite good , actually . I'm pretty sure you're demanding , but fair and honest . I feel we can work together . __eou__
 Good , well , here's what I need from you . Are you ready ? __eou__  Shoot ! __eou__
 Right.The choice is yours , the tall one or the short one ? __eou__  I should take the taller one for the choice . __eou__
Hi , Bill.It ' s Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd.How are you ? __eou__  Hello , Marsha . I'm great and you ? __eou__
 Hello , Marsha . I'm great and you ? __eou__  Not too bad at all.Do you have a minute ? __eou__
 Not too bad at all.Do you have a minute ? __eou__  Sure , what can I do for you ? __eou__
 Sure , what can I do for you ? __eou__  We're ready to place our Christmas order and we need a formal bid . __eou__
 So this is a real thing ? __eou__  Right , this is not a drill . This is for all the marbles . __eou__
 When do you need it ? __eou__  ASAP , in writing of course . __eou__
 Sure , who am I bidding against ? __eou__  The usual guys , so you better use a sharp pencil . __eou__
 Is this about the Sales Assistant position ? __eou__  That's right . My appointment is for 11 o'clock . __eou__

 Nigel Smith . Does he have your number , Mr . Smith ? __eou__  It's 2781703 1 . __eou__
Next is a ballet performance , but who is the dancer ? __eou__  I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation . __eou__
 Since when did Eddy start doing ballet ? ! __eou__  Not very long from the looks of it ! __eou__
 Can you even hear what he's saying ? __eou__  No . He's so far away I can hardly see him ! Let's keep eating ! __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__  I'm looking for someone who works here , but I lost his business card . His name's Long or Sang or something like that . __eou__
 Chang ? __eou__  Yeah , that sounds right . __eou__
 There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ? __eou__  Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that . __eou__

 Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . __eou__  Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? __eou__
 It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? __eou__  The accounts department , I think . __eou__
 The kitchen god ? What does he do ? __eou__  He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! __eou__
 What is it ? Tell me ! Will it work for Lester , too ? __eou__  I think so ! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week . That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you ! __eou__
 Hmm . Are you sure that will work ? I already tried giving chocolate to Lester . __eou__  And what happened ? __eou__
 Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here ! __eou__  Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company . __eou__

 Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ? __eou__  Yes . He usually replies immediately . __eou__
 So , what did you win ? __eou__  A lousy desk lamp . And you ? __eou__
 A lousy desk lamp . And you ? __eou__  A bar of soap ! __eou__
 Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing . __eou__  Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... __eou__
 Okay , more relaxed . Got it . Hey , Sally , what ' s up ? It's Tracy here , just . __eou__  Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms . Cooper , I'm writing to confirm ... ? __eou__
 Your company is very well respected . About how long have you been in business ? __eou__  Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California . __eou__
 And this is your company's head office ? __eou__  Well , yes , but now we have six offices in California alone . __eou__
 That's wonderful . Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation ? __eou__  That's right . We are their sole PR sector business . __eou__
 That's not bad . How long have you been in PR ? __eou__  Not long actually . So I'm sure I will learn a lot from our cooperation . __eou__
These three hours chatting with you have been very ... interesting . Could you please tell us why we're here ? __eou__  I want a new brand image . Something creative , something strong . Make no mistake , something with ... resolve ! __eou__
 What is our time frame ? __eou__  Let's meet on Friday to discuss your progress . Give me your e-mail address ... umm , I mean addresses ... We'll be in touch . __eou__
Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? __eou__  Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! __eou__
 What's next ? Tony Blair in high heels ? __eou__  Sure . I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . __eou__
 I see . And how about the working hours ? __eou__  Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . __eou__
 And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? __eou__  Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . __eou__

 Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__  Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__
 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__  Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever . __eou__
 So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__  Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . __eou__

 Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? __eou__  Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable .

 Didn't you get the memo ? __eou__  What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . __eou__
 It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ? __eou__  I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler . Anyway , I am sure the memo never got to my in-box . I'll have to talk to our secretary about it . __eou__
 Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ? __eou__  It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications . __eou__
 Is that all ? __eou__  Yes.Please get this memo typed up and distributed to all employees before 4 pm . __eou__
 When will we get one of those ? __eou__  You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . __eou__
 This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? __eou__  The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__
 Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ? __eou__  He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens ' training evaluations as well . I'll get you his card , you can give him a call . __eou__
 To visit our supplier ? __eou__  Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . __eou__
 By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? __eou__  No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . __eou__
 I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? __eou__  I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . __eou__
ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ? __eou__  Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . Is it still available ? __eou__
 Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . Is it still available ? __eou__  Thank you for your interest . The position is still available . Have you already sent your CV to us ? __eou__
 Thank you for your interest . The position is still available . Have you already sent your CV to us ? __eou__  No , not yet . First , I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information . __eou__
Hello . This is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? __eou__  Yes . __eou__
 Where are you ? __eou__  I am still in XYZ Company , this meeting took longer than I expected . Say to it that the office manager knows I won ’ t be in to punch my card . __eou__
I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . __eou__  Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . __eou__
 What is the problem ? __eou__  I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . __eou__
 How ? __eou__  You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . __eou__
Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? __eou__  Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . __eou__
 Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? __eou__  I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-step research before I send my application letters out . __eou__
 How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? __eou__  I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . __eou__
Marketing Manager ’ s Office . Can I help you ? __eou__  Mr . Smith , please . __eou__
 What time do you expect him back then ? __eou__  Sorry , I am not sure . Can I take a message ? __eou__
When can I have your firm C . I . F . prices , that is to say , the final offer , Mr . London ? __eou__  We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ? __eou__
 How did I do ? __eou__  Not so good . Lots of complains . __eou__
 Really ? I thought I was doing well . __eou__  Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . __eou__
 How much do you spend on development every year ? __eou__  About 3-4 % of the gross sales . __eou__
 What ’ s that building opposite us ? __eou__  That ’ s the warehouse . We keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . __eou__
 If I placed an order now , how long would it be before I got delivery ? __eou__  It would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want . __eou__
How do you think the report I wrote ? __eou__  Not bad . But there is more room for improvement . __eou__
 It ’ s a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . Brown . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . May I know what particular items you ’ re interested in ? __eou__  I ’ m interested in your hardware . I ’ Ve seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in Canada . Here is a list of my requirements , for which I ’ d like to have your lowest quotations , C . I . F . Vancouver . __eou__
 I ’ m interested in your hardware . I ’ Ve seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in Canada . Here is a list of my requirements , for which I ’ d like to have your lowest quotations , C . I . F . Vancouver . __eou__  Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offers ? __eou__
 What about the commission ? From European suppliers I usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports . It ’ s the general practice . __eou__  As a rule we don ’ t allow any commission . But if the order is a substantial one , we ’ ll consider it . __eou__
How do I submit an expense report ? __eou__  You need all your receipts for reimbursement . __eou__
 You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? __eou__  Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you . __eou__
 After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? __eou__  I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start . __eou__
 Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ? __eou__  We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day . __eou__
 Is there probation ? __eou__  No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week . __eou__
 What do you need ? __eou__  I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . __eou__
 Here you are . Do you need glue ? __eou__  That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue . __eou__
 So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? __eou__  In our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early . __eou__
I call this meeting to order . Thank you all in attendance today , I know it's a busy day for you all . We have a lot of material to cover today . Did everyone get an agenda ? __eou__  I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . __eou__
 Good . Do I have a second ? __eou__  I second . __eou__
 motion carried . Now , next on our agenda is our budget review . Margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? __eou__  I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . We've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . Here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . Basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left . __eou__
 How long is my paid vacation every year ? __eou__  You ’ ll have 10 days paid vacation every year . __eou__
 What about the insurance and housing policies ? __eou__  We will provide you wit life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . __eou__
 How often is the bonus ? __eou__  You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . __eou__
 Do I have training opportunities ? __eou__  We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . __eou__
 Do you think it's that serious ? __eou__  Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep . __eou__
What's our target audience for this campaign ? __eou__  This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . __eou__
 Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? __eou__  Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . __eou__
 Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? __eou__  Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . __eou__
What kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ? __eou__  Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . All together , there will be 15 events . __eou__
 What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... __eou__  It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . __eou__
 Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? __eou__  We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . __eou__
 Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? __eou__  It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . These are the events that our customers and potential customers care about . __eou__
How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? __eou__  Let's see ... You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean , and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . __eou__
 Fine . We will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__  No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . __eou__
What are our areas for growth ? What sectors do you see the most potential in ? If we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board . __eou__  It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand . __eou__
Which of the steps are you focusing on in brandgrowth Awareness , understanding , acceptance , or loyalty ? __eou__  We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . __eou__
 What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ? __eou__  Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like . __eou__
 Why is the price so high ? __eou__  It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . __eou__
 Model of computers aren't compatible ? __eou__  Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . __eou__
Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? __eou__  Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . __eou__
 Do we also need to punch out after work ? __eou__  According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . __eou__
 How about the lunch break , Lucy ? __eou__  From eleven thirty to 1 o ’ clock . __eou__
Good morning , I am Monica . Are you Mr . White , the manager of finance department ? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . __eou__  Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! __eou__
 Really ? What could that be ? __eou__  Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . __eou__
 Should each of us write separately ? __eou__  Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . __eou__
 What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . __eou__  Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . __eou__

 I said , is Mr . Thomas there ? __eou__  Pardon ? The line is bad . Don ’ t hang up please . I ’ ll have the call transferred to another line . __eou__
 Would you like some coffee or tea ? __eou__  Coffee would be fine . __eou__
 How would you like your coffee ? __eou__  I like it black . __eou__
 Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and James Smith , which one would you like to speak to ? __eou__  I ’ d like to speak with Mr . Robert Smith . __eou__
 Shall we need at one fifteen this Thursday ? __eou__  We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__

 I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . __eou__  I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job . __eou__
 Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ? __eou__  I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system . __eou__
 How do you work with a team ? __eou__  I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members . __eou__
 What ’ s your long term goal ? __eou__  I ’ d like to bring to ABC Company not only my technical skills , ambition , enthusiasm , but also my loyalty , a sensor desire to become an administrative assistant . It is the hardest of my career plans . __eou__

I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time . __eou__
What are in this folder ? __eou__  They are reports of our company . __eou__
 Are they filed alphabetically ? __eou__  No , they are filed according to dates . __eou__
 This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . __eou__  I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . __eou__
 Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? __eou__  Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? __eou__
 Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? __eou__  Yes , it will print immediately . __eou__
 What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? __eou__  Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? __eou__
 All right , who should I send them to ? __eou__  It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . __eou__
 Ok , home or office address ? __eou__  Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . __eou__
Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? __eou__  Let me check . It has a paper jam . __eou__
 What are they ? __eou__  They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . __eou__
 And what is the most important point ? __eou__  You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule . __eou__
 Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . __eou__  Today , I am busy all day long . __eou__
 What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? __eou__  The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . __eou__
 Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? __eou__  Yes , it is not easy . __eou__
Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? __eou__  Yes , it is . __eou__
Good afternoon . How can I help you ? __eou__  Good afternoon . My name is Monica . I am here for the job interview at 2 PM . __eou__
 What about the 3rd round ? __eou__  Good question . But I will tell you when you pass the first two . __eou__
What ’ s up ? __eou__  I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? __eou__
 I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? __eou__  Do you mind I have a look at your computer ? __eou__
 I see . What can I do now ? __eou__  You can send a compressed one . __eou__
 Why , what's the lowdown ? __eou__  According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . __eou__
 Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ? __eou__  Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager . __eou__
How come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__  You mean the network connection ? __eou__
 You mean the network connection ? __eou__  Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . __eou__
What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? __eou__  No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . __eou__
How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? __eou__  Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . __eou__
 Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__  No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . __eou__
 If we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast . __eou__  We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but I'm not sure how to do it . __eou__
 We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but I'm not sure how to do it . __eou__  We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products . __eou__
 We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products . __eou__  Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ? __eou__
 Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ? __eou__  I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . __eou__
Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ? __eou__  From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market . __eou__
How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? __eou__  In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? __eou__
 In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? __eou__  Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . __eou__
 Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? __eou__  I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . __eou__
 So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? __eou__  I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . __eou__
 Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? __eou__  That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . __eou__
How did your company's fundraiser go ? __eou__  The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . __eou__
 So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? __eou__  Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . __eou__
What's the deal with the Asia area sales ? Did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ? __eou__  We got numbers back from our offices in Beijing , Hong Kong , Taipei , Singapore and Tokyo , we're waiting on Bangkok and Kula Lumpur . __eou__
 What do the preliminary figures tell you ? Any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the Far East ? __eou__  It's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets . __eou__
 For example ? __eou__  For instance , some products that do very well in Tokyo branch are a flop in Malaysia.We ' re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . Each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans . __eou__
 Good news for us . When can you start to work ? __eou__  It ’ s my honor to be one member of your company . I ’ d like to begin to work any time as you like . __eou__
 Employee welfare ? What all does that include ? __eou__  In the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations . __eou__
 What kind of considerations are we talking about ? __eou__  It is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights . We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . Let ’ s all welcome Ms . Michelle Cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman . __eou__
 Our company now has n ombudsman ? __eou__  Yes , that ’ s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate . If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart . __eou__
Are you free next thursday ? __eou__  Yeah , why , is there something going on Thursday ? __eou__
 Yeah , why , is there something going on Thursday ? __eou__  A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement . __eou__
 Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ? __eou__  Retirement age is still 65 , but I think more and more people are retiring earlier , I think Bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young . __eou__
 Wow ... I thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ? __eou__  Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ? __eou__
 What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? __eou__  Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat . __eou__
 What can I do for you ? __eou__  I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? __eou__
 I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? __eou__  Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese . __eou__
 Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ? __eou__  We aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . We would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other . __eou__
 So if I can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ? __eou__  We could give you an uncite office , as well as potential to develop your own contracts in Japan.At the same time , after helping with our project , we will be willing to split our profit with you . __eou__
How often are stockholders meetings held ? __eou__  Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . __eou__
 What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... __eou__  You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . __eou__
 So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? __eou__  Unless they're united , very little ... __eou__
 You would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? I'm sorry , sir , could you please clarify ? Who all is included in managerial staff ? __eou__  Managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility , or who has anyone working under them . It includes all supervisors and department heads . __eou__
 What about the senior account managers ? Do they count ? __eou__  No , they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers , but they do not directly supervise others . They are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training . __eou__
So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... __eou__  No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . __eou__
 How many people are on the board of directors ? __eou__  Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . __eou__
Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ? __eou__  Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . __eou__
 What's he studying ? __eou__  He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA . __eou__
 Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? __eou__  The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . __eou__
 Why is that ? __eou__  He just has his secretary do his homework for him . __eou__
 It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? __eou__  Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . __eou__
Francis , what ’ s that ? __eou__  Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure . __eou__
 How many departments do we have ? __eou__  Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch . __eou__
 Ok . Who should I report to ? __eou__  Mr . White , too . __eou__
 And I represent ? __eou__  Our company just concluded a business transaction . You can help with documenting varies financial sheets involved in this transaction . __eou__
Hello Mr . Jones , please have a seat . Thank you for coming in today . I have read your resume . You completed University in England ? __eou__  Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research . __eou__
 So , what experience do you have ? __eou__  I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department . __eou__
 I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ? __eou__  I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new . __eou__
 I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? __eou__  I would rather work full-time . __eou__
 I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? __eou__  I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year . __eou__
How long does it take to get to downtown from here ? __eou__  It is 15 minutes ’ drive . __eou__
 What companies do we have in our neighborhood ? __eou__  Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations . __eou__
 Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ? __eou__  Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building . __eou__
 It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ? __eou__  Yes , at the end of the hall . __eou__
 What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? __eou__  I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... __eou__
 Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? __eou__  There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on . __eou__
 Are you kidding ? __eou__  No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... __eou__
 Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? __eou__  Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ? __eou__
 Do you have an appointment ? __eou__  Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . __eou__
 What news ? __eou__  You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . __eou__
 You know what we will get ? __eou__  We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . __eou__
 What docking station ? __eou__  This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . __eou__
How come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__  You mean the network connection ? __eou__
 You mean the network connection ? __eou__  Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . __eou__
Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? __eou__  Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__
What ’ s up ? __eou__  I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? __eou__
 I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? __eou__  Yes , Do you mind if I have a look at your computer ? __eou__
 I see . What can I do now ? __eou__  You can send a compressed one . __eou__
Did you hear something ? __eou__  Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . __eou__
Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? __eou__  Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . __eou__
 Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? __eou__  Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . __eou__
 Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? __eou__  Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . __eou__
What are in this folder ? __eou__  They are reports of our company . __eou__
 Are they filed alphabetically ? __eou__  No , they are filed according to dates . __eou__
A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? __eou__  I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? __eou__
 I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? __eou__  Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . __eou__
You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? __eou__  Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . __eou__
 But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? __eou__  It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . __eou__
Where were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . __eou__  Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . __eou__
 Should each of us write separately ? __eou__  Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . __eou__
 Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? __eou__  No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . __eou__
How long have you been in this company ? __eou__  I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . __eou__
 Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? __eou__  It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . __eou__
Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? __eou__  How regular ? __eou__
 How regular ? __eou__  An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . __eou__
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? __eou__  Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . __eou__
 Totally agree . What is your solution ? __eou__  Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . __eou__
 To visit our supplier ? __eou__  Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . __eou__
 By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? __eou__  No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . __eou__
 I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? __eou__  I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . __eou__
Good morning , I am Monica . Are you Mr . White , the manager of finance department ? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . __eou__  Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! __eou__
 Really ? What could that be ? __eou__  Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . __eou__
Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? __eou__  It was a nightmare . __eou__
 What ’ s up ? __eou__  Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__
 Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__  Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__
 This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__  I am still waiting for their call . __eou__
Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week . __eou__  If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? __eou__
 If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? __eou__  I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract . __eou__
 Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? __eou__  Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? __eou__
 Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? __eou__  I don't think so , why do you ask ? __eou__
 I don't think so , why do you ask ? __eou__  The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... __eou__
 Like this one ? __eou__  Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . __eou__
 I'm try to write a letter to one of our clients , But I just don't know exactly what to say , I don't even know how to get started , I know I should write dear Mr . Mrs . or Ms . , but the problem is I don't know the name of contact person . __eou__  You can just put Dear Sir or Madam , officialese not personal , you can write to whom may concerned . __eou__
 OK , So I first thanks them for their business , I can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support , How is that ? __eou__  Good ! But also , write off the bed you want to tell them the reason of your writing , give them more reference . __eou__
 Right , do you need them to respond ? __eou__  Yes , the letter would have a survey inside , and they should complete it and return to our office . How should I write that ? __eou__
 Yes , the letter would have a survey inside , and they should complete it and return to our office . How should I write that ? __eou__  You can tell them " Please finding the enclosed customer service survey , else also , you can say Attach a customer survey . If you need resource it right away , you can tell them the urgent by saying Please return the survey without dely as soon as possible . Maye it more polite with this as early as convenience . __eou__
So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? __eou__  Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! __eou__
 What was so bad about it ? __eou__  Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . __eou__
Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? __eou__  Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . __eou__
 Do we also need to punch out after work ? __eou__  According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . __eou__
 How about the lunch break , Lucy ? __eou__  From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock . __eou__
 What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . __eou__  Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . __eou__
 Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ? __eou__  That's an excellent question . I'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . The reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . As you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear . __eou__
 How long will the tour take ? __eou__  It should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . All together our tour should last about half an hour . __eou__
 We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . __eou__  You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . __eou__
 OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? __eou__  I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . __eou__
Did you put this morning's faxes on my desk ? I'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters , I'm pretty sure they came in last night . __eou__  Everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk . But I noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred . Maybe you can take a look at them . If the copy is unreadable , I'll call them and ask them to relax . __eou__
 What about that one ? __eou__  This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it . How can that be ? __eou__
 This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it . How can that be ? __eou__  You know , I think the fax machine is out of toner , I can change the toner cartridge . That should solve the problem . __eou__
 Let me key in your information into my computer . I will pull up our records for you . Do you have an order number ? What name is the order listed under ? __eou__  It should be under Leslie Smith . The number is 184796 A . __eou__
 Is there the correct billing address ? __eou__  No , PLS post the bill to 124 Hildrod Lane , Milton County , 98830 . __eou__
 Just a moment . I'll check to see if she is at her desk.May I tell her who is calling ? __eou__  This is Bill Burton from Milford Insurance , I'm calling in regards to our meeting next Tuesday . __eou__

Thank you for calling to remind me . Actually . I do need to change the time of my appointment . I have a scheduling conflict . And I can't make it that early . __eou__
 If I put you in at a later spot , would that work out ? __eou__  It would have to be after lunch . Do you have anything available about 2 o'clock ? __eou__
 It would have to be after lunch . Do you have anything available about 2 o'clock ? __eou__  Sorry ma'm , the only opening we have after lunch is one fifteen , but I might be able to work you in after 4 . would that be a better time ? __eou__
 That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? __eou__  3000 RIB as bonus for each person . __eou__
 What about the afternoon ? __eou__  At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . __eou__
 All right , who should I send them to ? __eou__  It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . __eou__
 Ok , home or office address ? __eou__  Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . __eou__
 Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? __eou__  Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? __eou__

 What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? __eou__  Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? __eou__
 Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? __eou__  Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . __eou__
 Here is the copy . Do you need anything else ? __eou__  Yes , I also need all the letters we received from them . __eou__
 Do you mean all the sales letters from them ? __eou__  Yes , that ’ s right . __eou__
Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? __eou__  Let me check . It has a paper jam . __eou__
 Jessica , I am very sorry to hear that . Why are you leaving ? __eou__  I've been offered another job with higher salary . And it also gives me the opportunity of promotion . __eou__
 I am.What can I do for you ? __eou__  Form your company's advertisement in the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY , I learn that you are a foreign trade company of good service . I am interested in it.Here is my resume , ma'am . __eou__
 Very good , you majored in International Trade ? __eou__  Yes , I will graduate from the People's University of China this July majoring in International Trade.Besides , at school , I am a top student.Moreover , both my spoken and written English are pretty good . __eou__
Did you working in a similar position before ? __eou__  Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer . __eou__
 If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ? __eou__  I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility . __eou__
 Are you able to operate the telex ? __eou__  Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information . __eou__
 You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself ? __eou__  Exactly . As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting , I don't want it to get out of control . __eou__
 I see . Ok , then where do you think we will have the meeting ? __eou__  The conference room on the second floor , is that ok ? __eou__
 The conference room on the second floor , is that ok ? __eou__  Yes , I will see that the room is ready by Friday . And I will check there are enough chairs , and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right . __eou__
 Sure , I will . What about the minutes ? Do you think I am responsible for that too ? __eou__  Definitely . The minutes have to be taken accurately . __eou__
 Sure . Do you have my number ? __eou__  Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . __eou__
 Does Mark Wyatt work there ? __eou__  Mark Wyatt ? I am sorry . The line is terrible.Could you spell that for me , please ? __eou__
 Certainly , what day were you thinking of ? __eou__  How ’ s Thursday ? Does she have any time available then ? __eou__
 What are you doing ? __eou__  I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month . __eou__
 What kind of volunteer work ? __eou__  I help out at the children ’ s hospital . I help plan activities . __eou__
 Oh , yeah ? __eou__  Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . __eou__
 Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! __eou__  Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! __eou__
 Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place calledWild Things ? ! __eou__  OK , I get it ! ! Thank you for your very thorough analysis ! __eou__
 What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? __eou__  Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . __eou__
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__  My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . __eou__
 Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . __eou__  I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . __eou__
 When do you find a job satisfying ? __eou__  My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . __eou__
 How would your coworkers describe you ? __eou__  First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people .

 Do you know when they will start setting up interviews for the job ? __eou__  I'm not really sure about that . But I know we are still receiving resumes.Maybe after a week or two they will start calling applicants . __eou__
Have you ever worked as a tour guide ? __eou__  I have a little experience . I guided a few foreign tourists around Beijing last year as a part-time job . I showed them to the Great Wall , the Imperial Palace , and the Summer Palace . __eou__
 Have you applied with any other companies ? __eou__  No , this is my first . __eou__
 Is there anything you want to ask about ? __eou__  I'd like to be an overseas tour guide someday . Would there ever be any chance of that ? __eou__
 I'd like to be an overseas tour guide someday . Would there ever be any chance of that ? __eou__  Certainly . There'll be a good chance of that if you work for this company . Not right away , of course , but in a few years , after you learn more about our business , you may go overseas with a tour group . Any questions ? __eou__
When will I get a raise ? __eou__  In three months or so ? __eou__
 You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ? __eou__  Yes . __eou__
 Yes , of course . What is it ? __eou__  I need you to help me set up for my presentation Thursday morning . __eou__
 Well , it isn't at this office . It's over at the Dayton Street office.Have you been there before ? __eou__  Yes , of course . I have to go there every Tuesday . __eou__
 What's the presentation about ? __eou__  I will talk about developing sales through our website.All the branch heads will be there , and most of the staff . __eou__
 Will you need anything special for the presentation ? __eou__  Well , I need the display monitor.But Tom can set that up for me on Wednesday . I will need you to help with everything else . __eou__
Excuse me , I am Dunlin . I am here about your advertisement for a tourist guide . Are there still any vacancies ? __eou__  Yes . One more is needed . __eou__
 But do you have any experience like that ? __eou__  Yes . I have been a guide for two years . __eou__
 OK.Then I want to ask you some questions about the tourist guide.If there wasn accident , for example a tourist falls ill , what would you do ? __eou__  I think I will call the office to send someone to meet us , and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip . __eou__
 If one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant , would you let the tourist bus go back ? __eou__  No . In fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , I will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings . __eou__
This facility is great , don't you think ? __eou__  Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . __eou__
 Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? __eou__  No . __eou__
 Where do you go for lunch around here ? __eou__  Are you hungry ? __eou__
 Are you hungry ? __eou__  Not too bad . But I will be soon . __eou__
 I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ? __eou__  They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth . __eou__
 Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them . __eou__  For whom ? Cortex ? __eou__
 For whom ? Cortex ? __eou__  Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . __eou__
 No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ? __eou__  Maybe . I will look around . __eou__
 Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango . __eou__  That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site . __eou__
 Yes , Yuri ? __eou__  I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now.Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe . __eou__
 Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ? __eou__  No , sir . The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting , sir . __eou__
 Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news . __eou__  You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported . __eou__
 Sure . It's the third office down this hall . Are you looking for Bob ? __eou__  Yes . He told me to come by this morning . __eou__
 I'm sorry , but he's not in the office now . Do you have an appointment ? __eou__  An appointment ? __eou__
 An appointment ? __eou__  Yes . What time did he expect you ? __eou__
 Yes . What time did he expect you ? __eou__  He said I should come by this morning . He didn't give me a time.He said I could come any time before noon . __eou__
 He's here on Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Fridays . What day did you want to see him ? __eou__  Friday is good . __eou__
 Morning or afternoon ? __eou__  Morning . __eou__
 Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? __eou__  No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . __eou__
 What do you suggest ? __eou__  The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . __eou__
 You mean you want to run the meetings ? __eou__  No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . __eou__
Good afternoon , sales department.May I help you ? __eou__  Could I speak to Mr Wood , please ? __eou__
 And the number ? __eou__  01088256798 __eou__
 Really ? How come ? __eou__  My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult ! __eou__
 What do you mean ? __eou__  Maybe now I ’ ll get that promotion I was hoping for . __eou__
 So now do you want a full-time job or part-time job ? __eou__  At present , both are OK for me.What do you need most , then ? __eou__
 At present , both are OK for me.What do you need most , then ? __eou__  Now we really need some part-time workers.You see , our full-time staff knocks off at five pm , but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm.We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm.But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job.Since most of our customers are foreign , competence of good communication in English is necessary here . __eou__
 That is good of you to say so.When can you start working ? __eou__  How about next monday ? __eou__
 What time you suspect back them ? __eou__  Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ? __eou__
 What is the telephone number there ? __eou__  8826789 4 , extension to 208 __eou__
 When will you reach there ? __eou__  About ten.another thing is that I want an appointment with the customer at Changing hotel at three thirty this afternoon.please help me phone the customer so we can confirm now . __eou__
 What is the customer's name , and what is his room number ? __eou__  You can check them from the fax yesterday . __eou__
What type of people do you work with most effectively ? __eou__  I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . __eou__
 What things impress you in your colleagues ? __eou__  I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . __eou__
 What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? __eou__  The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . __eou__
 How do you organize and plan for major projects ? __eou__  I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . __eou__
 How do you manage your time in a typical day ? __eou__  I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . __eou__
Susan , Is the manager in this office ? __eou__  Yes . But he is meeting a client . __eou__
 Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? __eou__  What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . __eou__
 I think we have . Is there anything else to discuss ? __eou__  No . That's all , I guess . __eou__
Do you have a free moment ? __eou__  Sure , what do you need ? __eou__
 Sure , what do you need ? __eou__  I am having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? __eou__
 I am having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? __eou__  Well . First you have to turn this switch on . __eou__
 Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ? __eou__  Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress . __eou__
 For how long ? __eou__  3 years . __eou__
 Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ? __eou__  That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers . __eou__
 When am I supposed to start working ? __eou__  Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you . __eou__
 Ok . What else ? __eou__  They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? __eou__
 I see . What about the salary ? __eou__  Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . __eou__
Anything else ? __eou__  Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? __eou__
 Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? __eou__  Our employees receive 15 days of paid vacation every year . If you don't use the full 15 days , they carry over to the following year . __eou__
 How about sick days ? __eou__  You get 5 paid sick days . __eou__
 Any other benefits ? __eou__  Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . __eou__
So how was your interview ? __eou__  I haven't gone to the interview yet . It's tomorrow . I am so nervous . __eou__
 Hi , Mr Wang , who do you wish to speak to ? __eou__  May i speak to David please ? __eou__
 let me just grab your file . How long have you worked for us now ? __eou__  I've worked here as a sales representative for about a year now . __eou__
 one year already ? It's amazing how time flies like that . Are you enjoying your job ? __eou__  yes , but I'd like to have a chance at job advancement . __eou__
 I see . What job did you have in mind . __eou__  well , I've noticed that is a position available as a sales manager . __eou__
 do you understand what duties that job would entail ? __eou__  yes . I would be directly responsible for all of the sales representatives in my department . I assume there'd be more meetings , paperwork , and other responsibilities , too . __eou__
 that's right . Do you have any experience in management ? __eou__  yes . In fact if you look at my resume , you can see that I was a manager before I started this job . __eou__
 When do you expect him back ? __eou__  I think he'll be back in about an hour at least . __eou__
 Ok . Does he know your number ? __eou__  I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 . __eou__

 When do you expect him back ? __eou__  I'm not sure , he didn't say when he wound return . If you'd like.you can leave him a message until he is back to you until the moment it's free . __eou__
 Does he have your number ? __eou__  Yes , he does . But i give it to you again . 5264453 6 __eou__
 That was 5264453 6 , right ? __eou__  Yes , thank you very much . __eou__
 How long did you have in mind ? __eou__  I would like to take my two weeks vacation time . __eou__
I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? __eou__  That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . __eou__
 What kind of benefits are we talking about ? __eou__  Our standard package includes health insurance , two weeks vacation and a company car . __eou__
 Uh ... not normally . What do you have in mind ? __eou__  Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days . __eou__
 You mean for this afternoon ’ s meeting ? __eou__  That ’ s right I ’ m afraid I have to postpone it . Mr . Scott got sick and I have to attend the Speechmaker ’ s Symposium in his place . I ’ m leaving today , and I won ’ t be back until a week from Friday . __eou__
 I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ? __eou__  No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention __eou__
 You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? __eou__  To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on __eou__
 interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ? __eou__  That depends a bit on the problem at hand . There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail __eou__
 What , do you believe , are some of the key attributes that helped you to achieve such an outstanding increase in sales ? __eou__  I believe persistence and perseverance are key attributes . __eou__
 So the company will pay for everything ? __eou__  Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . __eou__
 That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ? __eou__  I ’ Ve already paved the way . You just have to give a presentation on what our products are . I will do the follow-up and close the sale . __eou__
Comfort Inn , may I help you ? __eou__  I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center . __eou__
 Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ? __eou__  During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in __eou__
 That sounds great . Do you accept checks ? __eou__  I ’ m sorry , sir , we don ’ t . But we do accept all major credit cards . __eou__
 I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? __eou__  Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t __eou__
 That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? __eou__  Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . __eou__
Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ? __eou__  Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn ’ t been out of my possession . __eou__
 Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ? __eou__  No . __eou__
 What ’ s this sir ? __eou__  It ’ s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it . __eou__
 What are these red things sir ? __eou__  Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily . __eou__
 Where do you see yourself five years from now ? __eou__  I see myself in a management position . __eou__
 Mmmm . I ’ m not sure if we have you down here . How do you spell your last name ? __eou__  It ’ s L-e-e . __eou__
 You mean I have to pay now ? __eou__  Oh no , we just make an impression of your card using our credit card machine . It ’ s in lieu of a deposit . If everything is OK when you check out , we give it back to you then . It ’ s pretty sta __eou__
 So who has to stay behind ? __eou__  Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . __eou__
 I hope you enjoyed your stay . __eou__  Definitely ! Very relaxing . __eou__
 What ? I only stayed three nights . __eou__  That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__
 But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . __eou__  I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . __eou__
Mr . Lee , all ready to check out ? We ’ Ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . How will you be paying ? __eou__  I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? __eou__
 I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? __eou__  The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . __eou__
 What ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ? __eou__  That ’ s the mini-bar . Each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . The items you consume are put on your bill . __eou__
 I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! __eou__  Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? __eou__
 Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? __eou__  Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this . __eou__
 Do you want the large size , or the small size ? __eou__  The large size please . Do Have you any writing-paper ? __eou__
 Yes , we do . I don't have any small pads . I only have large ones . Do you want a pad ? __eou__  Yes , please . And I want some glue . __eou__
 Is that all ? __eou__  That's all , thank you . __eou__
 What else do you want ? __eou__  I want my change . __eou__
 Mike , this is Leo in Sales . I was just calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow.Are we still on ? __eou__  Goodness ! It ’ s been so long I actually forgot . Let me see ... yes , it is on my calendar . __eou__
 Is your address still 1150 Lake Road ? __eou__  Yes , that ’ s correct . __eou__
 Oh , hi Kim . How ’ s it going ? __eou__  Great , thanks . I was calling to change our meeting next week . __eou__
 Ok , sure . When did you have in mind ? __eou__  Well , I was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , Our trip has been postponed until the 2nd . __eou__
 Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ? __eou__  Any form of picture I . D . will do . __eou__
 That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ? __eou__  Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ? __eou__
 Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ? __eou__  Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ? __eou__
 Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ? __eou__  Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag . __eou__
 You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ? __eou__  Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number . __eou__
 When do you plan to travel ? __eou__  I ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight . __eou__
 I understand . So that ’ s one ticket to New York , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . Will that be one-way or round trip ? __eou__  I wish I could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket . __eou__
 When would you like to return ? __eou__  My return date will be the 14th . __eou__
 OK . I have several seats available . Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? __eou__  Anything but a center seat is fine with me . The middle seat drives me crazy ! __eou__
 Will there be any layovers ? __eou__  No , all flights are direct . __eou__
 Perfect ! I ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ? __eou__  $ 800 dollars . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? __eou__  So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . __eou__
 Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? __eou__  I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? __eou__
 What seems to be the problem ? __eou__  It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . Is that true ? __eou__  I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__
 No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? __eou__  It ’ s possible . If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there . __eou__
 You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! __eou__  That ’ s the one . It seems that everyone is anxious to get to New York tonight . __eou__
Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? __eou__  She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . __eou__
 What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__  Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__
 Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__  She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? __eou__
 She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? __eou__  When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__
 you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__  It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__
 It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__  I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__
Hello , Parker . How ’ s everything ? __eou__  Can ’ t complain . And you ? __eou__
 Can ’ t complain . And you ? __eou__  Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ? __eou__
 Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ? __eou__  Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday . __eou__
have you finished going through the contract ? __eou__  yes , but I have a few questions for you . __eou__
 even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? __eou__  that ’ s correct . __eou__
 do you have any other questions ? __eou__  yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ? __eou__
 how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? __eou__  men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . __eou__
 why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ? __eou__  well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? __eou__
 well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? __eou__  I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ? __eou__
do you have a minute ? __eou__  sure , what would you like to discuss ? __eou__
 sure , what would you like to discuss ? __eou__  I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . __eou__
 can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? __eou__  oh , no . not at all . __eou__
 are you planning on studying abroad ? __eou__  no , sir . __eou__
 have you been given a better offer ? __eou__  Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work . __eou__
 well , what's the problem then ? __eou__  it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it . __eou__
 really ? I didn't know that would be possible . __eou__  sure , we'd be carry to lose a good worker like you . __eou__
how was your day ? __eou__  let ’ s start with you . How was yours ? __eou__
 let ’ s start with you . How was yours ? __eou__  it was really busy . I had to work straight through my lunch break . __eou__
 let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ? __eou__  it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . __eou__
 you look pretty upset . Are you ok ? __eou__  I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . __eou__
 what ’ s that ? __eou__  I got sacked today . __eou__
 you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? __eou__  well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week . __eou__
 how late were you ? __eou__  only about 5 minutes . __eou__
 you got fired for being a few minutes late ? __eou__  my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time . __eou__
Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ? __eou__  What ’ s to get ready ? __eou__
 What ’ s to get ready ? __eou__  Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? __eou__
 Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? __eou__  Nope . __eou__
 Have you updated your CV ? __eou__  Nope . __eou__
 sure . What do you need ? __eou__  well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . __eou__
 really ? Why ? __eou__  it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . __eou__
 well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? __eou__  the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . __eou__
are you ready for the meeting ? __eou__  yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? __eou__
 yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? __eou__  it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit . __eou__
 how's your assistant manager getting on ? __eou__  well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass . __eou__
 what seems to be the problem ? __eou__  well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing . __eou__
 if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ? __eou__  to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . __eou__
hello ? __eou__  good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . __eou__
 is there someone else I can talk to ? __eou__  she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? __eou__
 she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? __eou__  any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . __eou__
 Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? __eou__  I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . __eou__
hi , Isaiah . How are you ? __eou__  I ’ m well . And you ? __eou__
 I ’ m well . And you ? __eou__  fine . How ’ s your job going ? __eou__
 fine . How ’ s your job going ? __eou__  I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business . __eou__
 really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ? __eou__  I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs . __eou__
 how ’ s it going ? __eou__  it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming ! __eou__
 where will those be located ? __eou__  if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October . __eou__
 when will you find out ? __eou__  we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow . __eou__
how's your new job going ? __eou__  really well , thanks . __eou__
 how are you finding your new boss ? __eou__  she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . __eou__
 would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__  she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__
 how about your new co-workers ? __eou__  they are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . __eou__
 do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__  of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . __eou__
 do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__  sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__
 do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__  yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__
 do you like working in teams ? __eou__  I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . __eou__
how's your job search going ? __eou__  I don't know . I only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__
 I see . Have you found anything that you're interested in ? __eou__  I've only found a few openings in my field . __eou__
 what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__  I'm trying to find a job in sound engineering . __eou__
 there's not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ? __eou__  unfortunately not . If I can't find anything in the field , then I could also work in the tourism field . __eou__
 that's a good idea . You have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ? __eou__  yes . __eou__
 really ? what is it ? __eou__  it's a job at a recruitment agency . __eou__
 that's interesting . Do you think they'd hire me ? __eou__  well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . I think you'd be the perfect person for the job ! __eou__
 that's true . I might as well call them up and see if I can get an interview . Do you have the details ? __eou__  sure , it's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds . Good luck ! __eou__
 but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . __eou__  that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about tha __eou__
 let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? __eou__  I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . __eou__
 well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . __eou__  that ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . __eou__
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__  I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__
 Late night ? __eou__  Yeah , I got home around two . __eou__
Hi there ! My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? __eou__  Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . __eou__
hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? __eou__  I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? __eou__
 I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? __eou__  I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? __eou__
 I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? __eou__  I'm in between jobs at the moment . __eou__
 what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__  I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . __eou__
 have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? __eou__  no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? __eou__
 not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? __eou__  yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . __eou__
 do you have experience in the IT field ? __eou__  I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . __eou__
 do you speak Spanish ? __eou__  yes , but not fluently . __eou__
 that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? __eou__  I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . __eou__
 did you write a clear objective in your resume ? __eou__  no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . __eou__
hi , Betty.what ' s up ? __eou__  nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? __eou__
 nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? __eou__  everything has been fine for the past several months . __eou__
 sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? __eou__  as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . __eou__
How's your job search going ? __eou__  I only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__
 have you finished compiling your resume ? __eou__  yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? __eou__
 good . How about your cover letter ? __eou__  a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? __eou__
 a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? __eou__  no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of __eou__
 yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ? __eou__  you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil __eou__
 then what should I do when I'm being interviewed ? __eou__  smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . Try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview __eou__
 are there any other things I should pay attention to ? __eou__  yeah , wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual . That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression . __eou__
Have you made up your mind about not going back to your hometown after graduation ? Where else would you go ? __eou__  I would try to land a job in Beijing . I just want to go to one of the big cities . __eou__
 why ? __eou__  many say more development opportunities can be found there . __eou__
 one person ? How about your girlfriend ? __eou__  oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . __eou__
do you have s second ? __eou__  sure . What do you want ? __eou__
 sure . What do you want ? __eou__  I want to tell you I've put in my notice . __eou__
 really ? Why ? __eou__  I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . __eou__
 and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? __eou__  yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received __eou__
What did you do at the office today ? __eou__  I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . __eou__
 What kind of things did you need to check ? __eou__  The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the __eou__
 I see . Did anything else happen ? __eou__  I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required __eou__
 I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? __eou__  Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__
 thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ? __eou__  no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . __eou__
 why is that ? __eou__  well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . __eou__
 I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? __eou__  Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . __eou__
 Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? __eou__  Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that so __eou__
Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? __eou__  Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . __eou__
 I see . And how about the working hours ? __eou__  Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . __eou__
 And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? __eou__  Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . __eou__
Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? __eou__  Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . __eou__
 So , what changed ? __eou__  Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . __eou__
 I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__  I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . __eou__
 Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__  Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__
 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__  Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so . __eou__
 So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__  Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . __eou__
 Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? __eou__  Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . __eou__
 What would you say is your most positive quality ? __eou__  Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career . __eou__
Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? __eou__  Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . __eou__
 Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? __eou__  Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . __eou__
 What did that involve ? __eou__  Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . __eou__
 Certainly . And after your internship ? __eou__  They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really __eou__
 ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ? __eou__  that ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s __eou__
hello . How was the marketing meeting ? __eou__  hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted . __eou__
 so what happened in the meeting ? __eou__  one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting . __eou__
What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__  Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__
 So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__  No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . __eou__
 How can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__  You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . __eou__
 What else do you suggest ? __eou__  Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . Th __eou__
 That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? __eou__  See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too . __eou__
 Do you enjoy working in this office ? __eou__  Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . __eou__
 What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? __eou__  We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su __eou__
What ’ s your working day like ? __eou__  I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . __eou__
 Do you get paid onetime ? __eou__  No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . __eou__
 Do you have any breaks ? __eou__  We have an hour-long lunch break form 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . __eou__
 My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__  There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__
What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? __eou__  First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__
 The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? __eou__  Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . __eou__
 When will the branch office open ? __eou__  Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . __eou__
 Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? __eou__  Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines . __eou__
 Ok . I understand that we basically work form 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ? __eou__  That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . __eou__
 How often do you have meetings ? __eou__  You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects.Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee __eou__
 You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ? __eou__  I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork . __eou__
 That ’ s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ? __eou__  That ’ s right . Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible . __eou__
Then , I ’ ll see you next week , Ms . O ’ Brian ? __eou__  Yes . Let ’ s say Tuesday at noon . Bring your portfolio with you . __eou__
 Certainly . Is there anything else you would like me to bring , Mr . O ’ Brian ? __eou__  No , that ’ s all . I already have your resume . __eou__
 Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? __eou__  Not at all , sir . I ’ d just like to push it up to next week . I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week . __eou__
Mr . Reynolds ? Rick Murphy . I ’ m the accounting manager for Macmillan and Emory , Incorporated . __eou__  Nice to meet you . How can I help you ? __eou__
 Nice to meet you . How can I help you ? __eou__  I would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account . __eou__
when are you going to give me those brochures ? __eou__  What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week . __eou__
 The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ? __eou__  Yes , I pretty much understand the company . __eou__
 Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ? __eou__  Yes , I've been observing them . __eou__
 When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ? __eou__  I already have something to wear . __eou__
 Make sure that you understand the company . Do you understand what it is that they do ? __eou__  No , I probably need to do some more research . __eou__
 So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear . Do you have something to wear ? __eou__  I have absolutely nothing so far . __eou__
 Yes , where should we go from here ? __eou__  Focus on being relaxed and open , don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . I'm sure you'll do well . __eou__
Richard ? Do you have the number for that Chinese restaurant on the corner ? __eou__  Yeah , hold on a second . I ’ Ve got it in my office . Here it is . 553-2213 . __eou__
 Happy to meet with you . Now , do you prefer group projects ? __eou__  I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group . __eou__
 Do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead ? __eou__  I want to grow in my job and move ahead . __eou__
 How much do you need to make per year ? __eou__  75,000 per year . __eou__
 Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ? __eou__  I need help with food . __eou__
 OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ? __eou__  I think it should be casual . __eou__
 I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ? __eou__  I would prefer Chinese food for this party . __eou__
 Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ? __eou__  I think we should hire a live band . __eou__
 Good idea . We could meet on Monday or Tuesday . Which day would you prefer ? __eou__  Tuesday would be good for me . __eou__
 OK . Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon ? __eou__  I think the afternoon would be best . __eou__
 Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ? __eou__  I feel that the whole committee needs to be there . __eou__
 Yes , I agree . We'll make sure that they get notified . Can you find the meeting place ? __eou__  Yes , I know how to get there on my own . __eou__
 Of course , I have Monday or Tuesday available . What day would be best for you ? __eou__  I would like to meet on Monday . __eou__
 Very well then . Are mornings or afternoons best ? __eou__  I want to come in the morning . __eou__
 Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee ? __eou__  I think that we should have just the sub-committee . __eou__
 OK then , I will make the arrangements for them to attend . Do you know how to get there ? __eou__  No , I need directions , please . __eou__
 And then ? __eou__  I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone . __eou__
 I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ? __eou__  Yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card . __eou__
 Yes . Can I help you ? __eou__  Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . __eou__
 Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . __eou__  Of course I remember you . __eou__
 Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . __eou__  Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? __eou__
 Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? __eou__  No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? __eou__
 Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? __eou__  No . It's been empty the whole time . __eou__
 I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? __eou__  No . My friend did . __eou__
 Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? __eou__  No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . __eou__
 I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? __eou__  Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . __eou__
 Should I call the police ? __eou__  You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . __eou__
Oh , my God ! What's this ? __eou__  What ? __eou__
 What ? __eou__  Look ! This window is open . __eou__
 Did you open it before we left ? __eou__  Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? __eou__
 Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? __eou__  I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? __eou__
 I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? __eou__  No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . __eou__
 I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! __eou__  Look around . __eou__
 But what if someone's still up there ? __eou__  I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ? __eou__
 I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this . Do you know them well ? __eou__  Not really . __eou__
 Do you know where they're vacationing ? __eou__  I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . __eou__
 Yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . Don't you think ? __eou__  Yes , I suppose . It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping . __eou__
Hi ! What are you watching ? __eou__  It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting . __eou__
 Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__  They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . __eou__
 Why do they go there ? __eou__  Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__
 Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__  I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__
 Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__  Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . __eou__

 What do you think will happen ? __eou__  Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate . __eou__
Why are you holding me in this jail cell ? __eou__  We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night . __eou__
What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__  I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__
 How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__  I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro __eou__
 Some what ? __eou__  Weed ! You know ? Pot , Ganja , Mary Jane some chronic ! __eou__

 That will probably be best . Do you need help with directions ? __eou__  I think I know where it is . Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure . __eou__

Why are you in court today ? __eou__  I got a ticket , and I would like to fight it . __eou__
 Is the officer that pulled you over here today ? __eou__  He's here . __eou__
 There was no picture taken of your license plate ? __eou__  I don't believe it took my picture . __eou__
how are you doing ? __eou__  I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . __eou__
 what happened to him ? __eou__  he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . __eou__
 was it his first offence ? __eou__  unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . __eou__
 what happened to him then ? __eou__  not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . __eou__
 did they take his license away ? __eou__  no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . __eou__
 what do you think will happen to him ? __eou__  well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . __eou__
 that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? __eou__  not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . __eou__
What's going on here ? __eou__  You mean , what's happening ? Well , constable , I'm trying to get out of the windowand Fred here is helping me . __eou__
 Just a minute you two . I don't think you're telling me the truth . This isn't poorhouse , is it ? __eou__  No , it's my brother's . I'm staying with him for a while . __eou__
 Is he at home ? __eou__  I'm afraid not . He's in jail for house-breaking at the moment . __eou__
911 emergency . What is the problem ? __eou__  I would like to report a break-in . __eou__
 When was this break-in ? __eou__  I believe it happened last night . __eou__
 Where was the break-in ? __eou__  It happened at my house . __eou__
 Was anything stolen ? __eou__  I haven't checked yet . __eou__
 Why do you think there was a break-in ? __eou__  My front window was broken . __eou__
Did you hear anything about the robbery ? __eou__  I watched it happen . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes . I was right there . __eou__
 What did you see ? __eou__  This guy tried to rob the bank . __eou__
 What happened next ? __eou__  He tried to leave with the money . __eou__
 Did he get caught ? __eou__  They caught him before he could walk through the front door . __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__  I would like you to be my lawyer . __eou__
 What can I do for you ? __eou__  I ’ m going on trial . __eou__
 What is your trial about ? __eou__  It ’ s a felony charge . __eou__
 How much do you charge ? __eou__  My rate is $ 150 an hour . __eou__
 About what ? __eou__  I want to speak to you about this year ’ s election . __eou__
 Oh , really ? __eou__  Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign . __eou__
 Will you be voting ? __eou__  Yes , I am going to vote . __eou__
 What do you want to speak to me about ? __eou__  I want to talk about this year ’ s election . __eou__
 Oh , you do ? __eou__  I am volunteering for the campaign . __eou__
 What made you decide to volunteer ? __eou__  I want to be a part of history . __eou__
 Do you plan on voting ? __eou__  I will be voting . __eou__
Are you going to vote on Tuesday ? __eou__  Of course . How about you ? __eou__
 Of course . How about you ? __eou__  I ’ Ve already voted . __eou__
 How ’ s that ? __eou__  I sent in an absentee ballot . __eou__
 Why ? __eou__  I won ’ t be able to vote on Tuesday . __eou__
 Why not ? __eou__  I have to work . __eou__
 Why don ’ t you go to work late ? __eou__  I have important business to take care of that morning . __eou__
Did you need help ? __eou__  Where do I go to pick up my ballot ? __eou__
 Where do I go to pick up my ballot ? __eou__  I ’ ll help you with that . __eou__
 How ’ s that ? __eou__  I ’ m working here today . __eou__
 What am I supposed to do now ? __eou__  All you have to do now is vote . __eou__
Hello , welcome to IBA . What can I do for you ? __eou__  Do you offer a safety deposit box rental service here ? __eou__
 Do you offer a safety deposit box rental service here ? __eou__  We certainly do . May I ask you the purpose of the rental ? __eou__
 I see . We have various rental periods . How long would you like to rent it for ? __eou__  What rental do you offer ? __eou__
 What rental do you offer ? __eou__  You can choose a short-term or yearly rental . __eou__
Good afternoon . What service do you require ? __eou__  I'd like to rent a safety deposit box here , please . __eou__
 For what purpose exactly , if you don't mind me asking ? I must ask because I need to know the size , you see . __eou__  No problem . My husband bought me some beautiful jewellery for our anniversary and I don't feel safe keeping it in the house . Initially , on the advice of a friend , I stored it in the freezer . __eou__
 What a lovely gift . Yes , I can understand why you wouldn't be comfortable keeping something so valuable at home . I think one of our small ones will be perfect . Do you have some ID with you ? __eou__  Yes , right here . So , we can do this today , then ? That will definitely ease my mind . __eou__
Good morning and welcome . How can I help you ? __eou__  Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental , please ? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office . __eou__
 I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time . __eou__  You can have more than 1 key if you'd like , but we must have signature cards for each box . __eou__
 How can I help you ? __eou__  I need to see if check number 212 has cleared yet . __eou__
Good afternoon , what can I do for you today ? __eou__  I'd like to get some details about a Personal Housing Loan , please . __eou__
 Well , congratulations ! It's lovely being a newly wed , but also so much pressure . Could you tell me what kind of property you are looking for ? __eou__  Yes , just a simple apartment , nothing too big . __eou__
Hello , Lincoln Bank . Kristy speaking , how may I help you today ? __eou__  Hello , Kristy . Could I speak to the department that deals with credit card applications , please ? __eou__
 Hello , Kristy . Could I speak to the department that deals with credit card applications , please ? __eou__  I can deal with that , Sir . Are you interested in our personal or corporate card ? __eou__
 I can deal with that , Sir . Are you interested in our personal or corporate card ? __eou__  The personal card , please . Is it possible to take care of this over the phone ? __eou__
 The personal card , please . Is it possible to take care of this over the phone ? __eou__  I'm sorry , Sir , but you will need to come in to your local branch to deal with the application procedure . Come in and fill out an application form and let us have a duplicate of your ID card . You'll also need a copy of your guarantor's and he or she will need to sign the form , too . __eou__
 OK ... and what deposit do I need ? I mean , is there a minimum deposit ? __eou__  You'll need to deposit 1,500 RIB initially . There will also be some small additional charges for this service . __eou__
 That's no problem . How long will the whole thing take ? A week ? 10 days ? __eou__  It should all be sorted out within 5 working days after receipt of the required documents . __eou__
Good afternoon . Can I help you ? __eou__  Is Ms April Wang available at the moment ? __eou__
 Is Ms April Wang available at the moment ? __eou__  I'm sorry , Sir . She's currently away at our sub-branch . Is there anything I can help you with ? __eou__
 I'm sorry , Sir . She's currently away at our sub-branch . Is there anything I can help you with ? __eou__  I hope so . I'm in the process of applying for a credit card with you , and Ms Wang asked me to drop off these documents . __eou__
 Do you need anything else from me ? __eou__  We do require a deposit before we can issue you with a personal credit card . __eou__
 No problem . How much ? If I don't have enough on me , I'll pop over to the ATM and draw some . __eou__  The minimum deposit is 1,500 RIB . But you will need to pay some small additional handling charges as well . __eou__
IBA , Maria speaking . How can I help ? __eou__  Hello , I called earlier regarding interest rates on loans . Sorry , I just have a couple more questions . __eou__
 What if I require a loan for a short period of time ? __eou__  What repayment period were you thinking of ? __eou__
 What repayment period were you thinking of ? __eou__  Say , 6 months ? Or less in fact . I want to repay the loan ASAP ; I don't like debt hanging over my head . __eou__
 What if I repay it early . Any perks ? __eou__  Well , we could adjust the interest rate based on the original rate and the amount of days you actually borrowed the money for . __eou__
Hello , Mr Mayhew . How are you today ? __eou__  I'm just fine , thanks , Jane . I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account , please . __eou__
 Would you like a balance inquiry first , Mr Mayhew ? __eou__  That might be a good idea , yes . __eou__
 Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ? __eou__  I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks . __eou__
 Actually , I have a suggestion for you . We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this ? __eou__  No , I don't think I have . But I would like to hear the full details , if you think it'll be beneficial to me . __eou__
Good morning , and welcome to our bank . What can I do for you today ? __eou__  I need some advice about my fixed deposits . __eou__
 What seems to be the problem ? __eou__  No , no problem . It's just that one of them is due and I'm not sure how to deal with it . __eou__
 No , no problem . It's just that one of them is due and I'm not sure how to deal with it . __eou__  I see . Well , you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it . Which would you prefer ? __eou__
 I see . Well , you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it . Which would you prefer ? __eou__  Mmmm ... well , I am happy with your service so far , so I'd like to renew it , please . __eou__
 Yes ... __eou__  You see , that means when anything is up for renewal , we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out . All you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you . __eou__
Hello . Did you enjoy the tour of our new premises ? __eou__  Yes , I did indeed . But , could you tell me what exactly the ' Priority Service Room ' is used for ? __eou__
 Yes , I did indeed . But , could you tell me what exactly the ' Priority Service Room ' is used for ? __eou__  Of course . As we provide many different services for all of our valued customers , we like to give than a special place to do their business with us . __eou__
 I think of myself as a valued customer . What services can you offer me ? __eou__  There are all kinds of deposit services and also the calculations of the interest . It's specific to different accounts and different circumstances . __eou__
 Right . Is there anything else that can be done there ? __eou__  There's information on deposit or loan rates , exchange rates ... __eou__
Welcome to NO Bank . It's Mr Zu , isn't it ? __eou__  Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have . __eou__
 How's Mrs Zu doing these days ? __eou__  She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see . __eou__
 Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do . __eou__  Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mr Meng . It's a little late for you , isn't it ? __eou__  Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , I've been stuck in back to back meetings all day , but I really wanted to come and speak to you . __eou__
 What can I help you with ? __eou__  I'm interested in putting some of my money into investment tools , you know , something other than stocks and such like . Do you have any ideas ? __eou__
 I'm interested in putting some of my money into investment tools , you know , something other than stocks and such like . Do you have any ideas ? __eou__  Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ? __eou__
 Yes , I've heard about that . Isn't it where many investors pool their money together ? __eou__  Exactly . Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . And , we provide a Professional Fund Manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us . __eou__
 How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ? __eou__  Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each . __eou__
 OK , what does that entail ? __eou__  It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . __eou__
 Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ? __eou__  Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . __eou__
Hello , and welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ? __eou__  Hello , Shelly , is it ? I'm here on behalf of my company , so I'll need the Corporate Banking Services . __eou__
 That's no problem . Do you offer any other consulting services ? __eou__  There are many services you can choose from . Why don't you take a look at this leaflet while I find someone who can help you ? __eou__
Consumer Credit Department . How may I help you ? __eou__  I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please . __eou__
 Certainly . Do you currently bank with us ? __eou__  Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already . __eou__
 I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ? __eou__  Of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 % __eou__
 So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ? __eou__  We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . __eou__
Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ? __eou__  My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . __eou__
 Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? __eou__  Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . __eou__
 What do you require ? __eou__  A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__
Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? __eou__  I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . __eou__
 Have you invested in the stock market before ? __eou__  No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . __eou__
 Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ? __eou__  Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . __eou__
This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ? __eou__  Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . __eou__
 We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? __eou__  Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . __eou__
 That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? __eou__  Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . __eou__
Hello , welcome to Credit Services . How can we help you ? __eou__  I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . __eou__
 Are you an existing customer ? __eou__  Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . __eou__
 May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance . __eou__  When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead . __eou__
Credit Services , how can I help you ? __eou__  I'd like to apply for a credit card with you . __eou__
 Would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ? __eou__  Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ? __eou__
 Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ? __eou__  Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB . __eou__
 Why such a big difference ? __eou__  It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . __eou__
 My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ? __eou__  Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . __eou__
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you ? __eou__  Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . __eou__
 So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? __eou__  Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . __eou__
 How so ? __eou__  For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops . __eou__
Welcome to Credit Services . How can I help you ? __eou__  Hello . I'm here to talk about my credit card . You see , I'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . I've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me . __eou__
 Is there anything else ? __eou__  There's quite a long list , actually ! You can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments . __eou__
 And I suppose I can do that anywhere ? I do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts . __eou__  If you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions . __eou__
It's Mrs Bardot , isn't it ? __eou__  Yes , it is . But I'm afraid we haven't met before . __eou__
 I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ? __eou__  Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . __eou__
 I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? __eou__  That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean . __eou__
 I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ? __eou__  The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . __eou__
Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ? __eou__  I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult . __eou__
 How so ? __eou__  Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . __eou__
 Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . __eou__  10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . What can we assist you with today ? __eou__  Hello . Yes , I've just read your leaflet about the new MoneyLink Card . I was wondering how I go about applying for one . __eou__
 Perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! So , I can just upgrade automatically ? __eou__  May I have your details , and I'll check for you . __eou__
Hello ! So , you're back . Do you have everything with you ? __eou__  I think so . __eou__
 What's the purpose for this check ? Would you like to know its repayment capacity ? __eou__  Yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . When do you think I can get hold of this report ? __eou__
 Yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . When do you think I can get hold of this report ? __eou__  As it's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it shouldn't take too long . There is , of course a service fee of 300 RIB to be paid . __eou__
Good morning , Sir . Can I help you with something ? __eou__  I hope so . I'm not actually a customer here , but I saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper about your new bank card . __eou__
 I see . Yes , the advertisement has proven very effective . Would you like to apply for a card with us ? __eou__  Yes , please . But I suppose I'll have to open an account with you first , right ? __eou__
 Yes , please . But I suppose I'll have to open an account with you first , right ? __eou__  That's right . But don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure . __eou__
 Of course , it can be done right this minute . If you could just fill in this application form for me ? Do you have your ID card with you ? I'll need to see that . __eou__  Yes , here you go . And sign here ? __eou__
 Yes , here you go . And sign here ? __eou__  Yes , please . That's being processed now . As soon as the account is set up , we can issue you with a card . __eou__
IBA , Jane speaking . How can I help you ? __eou__  Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card . __eou__
 Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ? __eou__  No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card . __eou__
 It's no trouble at all , Sir . Is there anything else I can help you with today ? __eou__  Nothing , thanks . I again apologise for the misunderstanding , bye for now . __eou__
 Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ? __eou__  Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with . __eou__
 I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ? __eou__  That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card . __eou__
How can I help you this afternoon ? __eou__  I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter . __eou__
 Thank you . And you require ... __eou__  800 RIB , please . __eou__
Good afternoon . This is Michelle Li speaking , calling on behalf of IBA . Is Mr Meng available at all ? __eou__  This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle . __eou__
 Shall I come in and collect it ? __eou__  Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number . __eou__
 Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money . __eou__  As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives . __eou__
Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ? __eou__  Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card . __eou__
 What seems to be the problem ? __eou__  I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it . __eou__
 Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ? __eou__  No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! __eou__
 You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? __eou__  Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? __eou__
 Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? __eou__  Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . What can I do for you today ? __eou__  I'd like to pay some money in using my card , please . __eou__
 I know what you mean . How much would you like to deposit with us today ? __eou__  1,000 RIB , it should all be there . __eou__
 OK , done . When will it show in my account ? Not for withdrawal , I mean just registered . __eou__  It will show in your account straight away . Here's your card back and could you please sign the slip here ? __eou__
Welcome . What can I do for you this morning ? __eou__  I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? __eou__
 I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? __eou__  Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ? __eou__
 How much would you like to withdraw ? __eou__  Is it OK to withdraw USD ? __eou__
Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__  I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? __eou__
 A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ? __eou__  A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . __eou__
 But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you . __eou__  We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . __eou__
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can I help you with , Sir ? __eou__  I'm not sure if I'm at the right counter , but I need some advice on mortgages , can you help me ? __eou__
I'm the Mortgage Advisor at this branch . You wanted a chat about housing loans ? __eou__  Yes , I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy . Unfortunately , I just don't have access to the cash . __eou__
 I see . It's a problem most of us face . May I ask what the purchase price is ? __eou__  It's 600,000 RIB . But I've already put down 200,000 RIB , which is my absolute limit , so I'm looking for a loan of 400,000 RIB . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . Do you need any assistance ? __eou__  Yes , please . I'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates . __eou__
 We offer many different payment plans . Would you be looking at long-term or short-term ? Are you looking at a 10 - year repayment plan ? __eou__  Definitely . I want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as I can . __eou__
 Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ? __eou__  I'll get our Mortgage Adviser for you . Please take a seat , I won't be a minute . __eou__
May I help you at all ? __eou__  Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? __eou__
 I see . What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible . __eou__  This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . __eou__
 So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? __eou__  That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see . __eou__
Good day ! What can we do for you ? __eou__  I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . __eou__
Personal Loans , how may I help ? __eou__  I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan . __eou__
 Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? __eou__  Not exactly . Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse . __eou__
 I see . What about age limitations ? __eou__  There are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age . __eou__
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? __eou__  Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today . __eou__
 Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ? __eou__  You do , I'm afraid . There are 3 ways to do this . You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . __eou__
 How can you help me ? __eou__  I work here . __eou__
 What do I do now ? __eou__  Go to a voting booth and vote . __eou__
Are you planning on voting ? __eou__  Yes . What about you ? __eou__
 Yes . What about you ? __eou__  Yes , but this will be my first time voting . __eou__
 Really ? __eou__  Yes , and I have no idea how to do it . __eou__
Are you going to vote ? __eou__  I am . Are you ? __eou__

Can you tell that I ’ m excited ? __eou__  What are you excited about ? __eou__
 What are you excited about ? __eou__  I voted today . __eou__

 Yes , I sure can . I feel like a dinosaur with all of these youngsters and their electronics . This machine is working , then ? __eou__  Yes , this one is in service . Put your card in here , in this slot and wait a moment . Then you will see some instructions on the screen . __eou__
 Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ? __eou__  Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back ! __eou__
 Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ? __eou__  Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it . __eou__
 Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ? __eou__  Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people . __eou__
Good morning , Madam . Is everything OK ? Is there something I can assist you with ? __eou__  Thank you , yes . I'm not sure how to use this ATM , I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book . But today , I thought I'd try something new . I want to take some money out . __eou__
 Thanks so much . Right , I've put my card in . What now ? __eou__  Just look at the screen here . It'll give you prompts , you see ? Now you need to enter your PIN number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it . __eou__
 Then it'll give me my money ? __eou__  Not right away , you need to decide what it is you want to do . The next thing is to select the service . __eou__
 Here we are ' withdrawal ' , so I just press here ? __eou__  Yes , then enter the amount you want . __eou__

 I don't have it to hand , but I know the number . It's 16211469 9 . Can you do anything , like stop the card for example ? __eou__  Let me repeat that back to you , 16211469 9 . That's just what I've done , Mr Kowalski , I've stopped your card temporarily . __eou__

 Just calm down , Sir . OK , when do you think you lost it ? __eou__  I'm not 100 % sure , around an hour ago I guess . I had it in the hotel lobby bar ; I used it to charge something to my room . I obviously didn't pick it up again . __eou__

 I see . How much exactly ? __eou__  500,000 RIB . Do you need me to give you my account number ? __eou__
 500,000 RIB . Do you need me to give you my account number ? __eou__  No , that's OK . I've got all of your information here on the screen in front of me . The money will be ready and waiting for you tomorrow . __eou__
Good afternoon . What can I help you with today ? __eou__  I have a Time Deposit here and I'd like to get the money now . __eou__
 The maturity date isn't for another 10 weeks . Are you aware of that ? __eou__  Yes , I know , but I need the money urgently for a family emergency , you see . I know I should apply in writing if I wish to withdraw , but I'm afraid there just isn't time . __eou__
Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? __eou__  I'd like to withdraw 35,000 RIB from my Corporate Account . __eou__
 Do you have an appointment ? __eou__  Yes , my name is Ms Jane Reeve , R-E-E-V-E . __eou__
 Ah , yes , Ms Reeve . I have all of your information here . Do you have the cash cheque ? __eou__  Here you go . __eou__
Hello , IBA Bank , how can I help you ? __eou__  Hello , I'd like to talk to someone about making a withdrawal . __eou__
 Yes , but the problem is that I have a Savings Account with you , and I need to take some money from that . Do I really have to give 90 days notice if I want my money ? __eou__  Actually , you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds . Of course , you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal . __eou__
This is IBA Bank , Claire speaking , how may I help you ? __eou__  Oh , hello , yes , arm ... I've just lost my bank stuff . __eou__
 Jim Chan . The account's in my name . Is that all you need to know ? __eou__  Not quite , Sir . We will need to also know the account number , the deposited amount and your PIN number . You will also have to come in and fill out some forms . __eou__
Welcome to IBA Bank , how can we be of service ? __eou__  I spoke to a girl named Claire on the phone ; it's about losing my card and everything . __eou__
 So , I can get my new card today ? __eou__  I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything . __eou__
 7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ? __eou__  If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours . __eou__
 Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ? __eou__  Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . __eou__
 What if I exceed ? __eou__  If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw . __eou__
 Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ? __eou__  It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits . __eou__
 So , if I do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ? __eou__  First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . __eou__
Hi , how can I help ? __eou__  I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit . __eou__
 Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ? __eou__  Yes , you will lose interest . I see that you have a 5 - year C / D with us . I'm sorry to tell you that would mean losing 6 months of interest as a penalty for withdrawing before maturity . __eou__
Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ? __eou__  No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago . __eou__
 You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit , right ? __eou__  That's correct . But before I do , I was wondering if you could give me some advice . __eou__
 Of course , Mr Hayes . That's what I'm here for . What would you like to know ? __eou__  Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity . __eou__
Hello , IMPF Bank , how can I help you ? __eou__  I need to report a missing Bank Card and Book . __eou__
Good day to you . How can I be of service today ? __eou__  Hello . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account . __eou__
 I see . Well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . There are 7 to choose from __eou__  Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ? __eou__
 Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ? __eou__  Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ? __eou__
 Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ? __eou__  For Agreement Savings , we ask for 100,000 RIB . __eou__
 And how do I withdraw if I need to ? __eou__  You can use a Type A Agreement Savings Account the same was as a Settlement Account . __eou__
 I'm sorry , refresh my mind . What's different about a Type B Account ? __eou__  With a Type B Account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service . __eou__
 Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ? __eou__  10,000 Japanese yen . __eou__
 OK , Sir . Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit ? __eou__  Fixed . __eou__
 And how long are you depositing for ? __eou__  For one year , that's what I usually do . Better interest , you know . __eou__
Foreign Currency Deposits Counter , yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__  You see , I have these Euros , and of course they are of no use to me at the moment . So I'd like to save them in my account , but I'm not sure how to go about it . __eou__
 I see . What's the interest like on those ? __eou__  There's quite a large difference . I mean , if you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0.13 % interest , but for a time deposit , of say , 1 year we would offer 0.82 % . __eou__
Hello Mr Fang ! It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? __eou__  Hello , Miao Ping . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account today . __eou__

 That's fine . Is it a Time Deposit ? __eou__  Yes , that's what my husband advised me to do . But I'm not sure how long I should save for . __eou__
 Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ? __eou__  For 6 months we can offer you 0.59 % . __eou__

 Yes , you can . Is that US dollars or HK dollars ? Both are available for exchange to RIB . How much would you like to exchange ? __eou__  Well , that depends . What's the rate like today ? __eou__

 Here we can exchange HAD , USD and Euros . Which do you require ? __eou__  To be honest , I really wanted to exchange my GAP , but I suppose USD will be fine . I have some and I just need a little local currency for expenses . Could you tell me what the rate is like today ? __eou__
Hello . Is everything OK ? Can I help you ? __eou__  Oh , wonderful ! You speak English ! I need to exchange this foreign currency . __eou__

 It's Traveller's Cheques , is that possible ? __eou__  Of course . If you could sign your name on the bottom line here , and write your address here . And please sign and date the back of every cheque and of course I'll need to see your passport . __eou__
Hello and welcome . How may I be of service ? __eou__  Hello . I want to buy some RIB , is it OK to use US dollars ? __eou__
 Yes , of course . What's the amount you'd like to change ? __eou__  I think 250 dollars should be sufficient . __eou__
 It's correct . Is there any way I can change it back before I leave the country ? __eou__  Yes , that can be done here . Just make sure you keep the exchange form and the receipt and you can come back at the end of your stay and we'll be only to happy to change it back into foreign currency . __eou__

Hi there , Mr Brown . Are you depositing or withdrawing today ? __eou__  Sorry to say it , but neither of those . I'm here to close our account with you . The market around here has been dropping for a while now , and it's just not sensible for us to stay . __eou__
 I understand . So , what would you like to do with the balance ? __eou__  I guess I should just withdraw everything . __eou__
Good day , what can I do for you ? __eou__  Could you fill me in on the details for buying foreign currency ? __eou__
 Of course . Where are you planning to travel to ? __eou__  Kula Lumpur , in Malaysia . __eou__

 Are there any extra charges , like commission ? __eou__  There is a service commission that you must pay . It's 1 % of the funds to be remitted , so you should pay an extra 6 RIB . __eou__
Hello , you seem a little lost . Can I help you ? __eou__  I've got a Remittance Advice and I'd like to cash it . __eou__
 That's no problem . The amount is 2,000 RIB , is that correct ? __eou__  Yes , that's right . __eou__

 I think account to individual would be best . But which is the quickest way ? __eou__  If you choose our Urgent Remittance Service the money can be there within 2 hours . There will be a 1 % handling fee and then you need to pay 12 RIB for the Express Delivery Service . __eou__
You're here to make a deposit , is that correct ? __eou__  Right . I'd like to deposit 2,000 RIB into my Current Account . __eou__

Good afternoon . Can I help you ? __eou__  Is it possible for me to buy some RIB at this counter ? __eou__
 How much would you like to change ? __eou__  Well , I'm only here for 3 days , so I think 500 GAP should be plenty . __eou__
Hello . What can we do for you today ? __eou__  I've just had some money sent from Germany , in Euros . __eou__
Sir , are you alright ? Just try to calm down , Sir . What's happened ? __eou__  I've lost my Traveller's Cheques , all of them . __eou__
 I see . You need the reference numbers ? For each cheque ? __eou__  Yes , Sir . Do you have that information with you ? At this bank , we always recommend our customers write down the reference number of each Traveller's Cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the Traveller's Cheques . __eou__

 That's no problem . Which currency would you like to buy ? __eou__  I think Euros will be the best , as I'll only be in Mainland Europe . __eou__
 Of course . Do you have your passport with you ? How much would you like to purchase ? __eou__  5,000 Euros will be sufficient , thanks . __eou__
Hi , good to see you . What can we assist you with today ? Going away on business again ? __eou__  Yes , I'm off again at the beginning of next week . I need to get some Traveller's Cheques . __eou__
 Ah , hello . Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques ? __eou__  Yes , we do . How can I help ? I can give you a simple introduction , if you'd like ? __eou__
 But what if something happened to them ? What would happen to my money ? __eou__  As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us , you are covered . No matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly . All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques . We will need that number if you need to make a claim . __eou__
Hello . What can I do for you ? __eou__  Hello . I'm here to get my salary . __eou__
 And how much of your salary would you like ? __eou__  I think just 3,000 RIB will be enough . __eou__
Hey , Mr Brown . How are you ? Look at that smile on your face ! __eou__  Recently it's been pretty good , actually . __eou__
 So , what can I do for you today ? Are you needing to withdraw or transfer ? __eou__  I'm going to need a Deposit Certification , to handle the affairs related to home . __eou__
Hi , can I assist you in any way ? __eou__  Oh , thank you . Yes , please . What I need is to handle some domestic affairs . __eou__
 Oh , I see . In what area ? __eou__  Well , I need a Deposit Certification to handle this . __eou__
 Yes , yes . Here it is . By the way , is there a handling fee ? __eou__  Yes , I'm afraid there is . __eou__
 You mean , if there is any left over ? __eou__  Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system . __eou__
 Right , so the deposit , if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification ? __eou__  That's right . I know we have a complex system , but you have caught on so quickly . __eou__
Hello , Sir . We haven't seen you for quite a while . So , what is it today that we can do for you ? __eou__  I need a Deposit Certificate to handle some stuff in land . __eou__
 Anything else you'll be needing today , Sir ? __eou__  Nope . That's everything , thanks . __eou__
Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? __eou__  I need to have some money transferred from the UK , from my company . It's kind of an emergency . __eou__
 That would be wonderful . The problem is I don't have an account with you . That is a problem , isn't it ? __eou__  Well , to be honest , it will slow things down a little . But it's not a big problem . You can do it by T / T . __eou__
 T / T ? What on earth is that ! ? Sorry , but I've never heard of it . T / T ? __eou__  It means ' telegraphic transfer ' . So , if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere , to anywhere in the world . __eou__

 I see . And your company has a Wage Distribution Service Agreement with us ? __eou__  So I was told , yes . They gave me this book ? __eou__
Good day , Madam . What service do you require today ? __eou__  I'd like some info about your Payroll Services , please . __eou__
 I see . How is it paid ? I mean , what payment methods are possible ? __eou__  We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account .

You've decided that you definitely want to purchase this particular one ? __eou__  To be honest , I haven't really done much research . __eou__
 And what does that entail ? __eou__  It's actually a Deposit Account that links to your Margin Account , the one you have with the Securities Company . You can transfer the money you have in your account into your Fund Account . __eou__
 How can I do that ? __eou__  You can use your Deposit Book or your Credit Card . And of course , you can use our e-banking . __eou__
 Thanks . OK ... your balance is 320,214 RIB . How much do you require today ? __eou__  I'll take 4,500 RIB , please . __eou__
Good day to you . How can we assist you today ? __eou__  Hello , yes , can I do Bank-Insurance Link business here ? __eou__

 Yes . Is that necessary ? __eou__  Well , it certainly makes everything easier , both at this end and at your end . __eou__
Good afternoon , how can I help ? __eou__  Hi there . I'd like to draw some cash from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Could I check my balance before I withdraw anything ? __eou__

Hello again . Have you come to a decision ? __eou__  I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ? __eou__
 I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ? __eou__  Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank . Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up . __eou__
 Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ? __eou__  Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution . __eou__
 So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ? __eou__  Technically , yes . __eou__
How can I help you today ? __eou__  I want to sign up for some funds units . How do I go about it ? __eou__
 Have you got some ID and your cash card ? __eou__  Yes . I've already got a fund account with you too . __eou__
 How many more fund units would you like to purchase today ? __eou__  I'm not quite sure . You see , I already have more than 5,000 RIB in my cash card , but I really don't know how much I should get . __eou__
Good afternoon . Can I be of service ? __eou__  I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ? __eou__

 Regarding what exactly ? __eou__  Fund info , the fund code , fund net value per unit , fund public info , fund account balance , fund trading conformation , daily details and the history . With our Net Banking , anything is possible ! __eou__
Hello , Madam . What can I do for you today ? __eou__  Hello . Yes , I'm here to redeem a Treasury Note . It's not at the maturity date yet , but it is an emergency . __eou__
 Oh , really ? No , I wasn't aware of that . __eou__  Unfortunately , yes . You see , this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago , but not over two years . So , you will have to pay . I'm sorry about that . __eou__
Hello there , Sir . I've dealt with you before , haven't I ? __eou__  You remember me ! Yes , I'm with Li Wang Enterprises ; I'm the Accountant Peters . __eou__
 Yes , of course , Mr Peters ! Good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? __eou__  Well , we've just acquired a new business so we need to set up a lot of services with you . We are particularly interested in Agent Services . __eou__
Do you have any questions before you commit yourself to this ? __eou__  Actually , yes I do . I was wondering about the subscription fee . And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund ? __eou__
 Actually , yes I do . I was wondering about the subscription fee . And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund ? __eou__  The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1.2 % . But for redeeming , a rate of a usual 0.5 % , we shall charge you 1.6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period . __eou__
 So , it's going to cost me then ? __eou__  I'm afraid so , yes . There is always some risk on the buyer's part . __eou__
Hi there . Do you need any help ? __eou__  I've been told about something called Southern Fund . How can I buy it ? __eou__
 I've been told about something called Southern Fund . How can I buy it ? __eou__  First of all , you should open a Fund Account with us , just fill in this form . We'll need to see some ID and your Cash Card . __eou__
 That sounds simple enough . Do you charge any admin fees for that ? __eou__  You'll have to pay 20 RIB , and then you will have your Southern Fund Management company card . __eou__
 Do you need any other documentation from me ? __eou__  Yes , we'll need to fill in this form , for fund trading and this one , for subscribing for and / or applying for purchasing fund units . The minimum is 500 RIB . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__  Yes . I'm sorry , but I've lost my passbook . __eou__
 Well . Can you tell me how much you have deposited ? __eou__  About RIB 12,000 . __eou__
Hi . Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__  Hello , yes , I opened an L / C with you recently . We opened it 7 days ago . __eou__
 Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ? __eou__  2,000 AD $ . __eou__
 Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ? __eou__  What is the difference between them ? __eou__
 What is the difference between them ? __eou__  The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one . __eou__
I want to send some money to Nanchang . Is it handled here ? __eou__  Yes , sir . How much would you like to remit ? __eou__
 No problem . Do you want the money to go by M / T or T / T ? __eou__  What's the difference ? __eou__
 What's the difference ? __eou__  If you take M / T , it will take a longer time for your brother to receive the money . __eou__
Good afternoon . Which service do you require . __eou__  I need to increase the amount of my L / C . It's quite a new one ; I opened it 12 days ago . __eou__
 How do I go about that ? __eou__  You'll need to fill in this application form and there is a charge of 30 US dollars for this . __eou__
Good afternoon , can I help you ? __eou__  Hello . I've been told to come in and see someone about my L / C . I just had a message to come in and see someone called Kristy . __eou__
 I'm Kristy . Can I help ? __eou__  I received a letter asking me to come in and see you . I'm Mr Simons from Dalton's Electrics . __eou__
 Oh dear ! Where should I go from here ? __eou__  I'd recommend going back to the 3rd party , personally this time , and discussing what exactly it is they aren't happy with . Hopefully you can reach some sort of agreement , which is viable for everyone . __eou__
 Hi Kristy ! What's going on ? __eou__  Do you remember coming in to do the L / C amendment last week ? __eou__

Good afternoon . May I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I'd like to make a deposit . __eou__
 Which type of deposit do you prefer , time deposit or current deposit ? __eou__  I prefer time deposit . __eou__

 Yep , you've got it ! What should we do ? __eou__  Usually , if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that .

 How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account . __eou__  The interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our Personal Financing . __eou__
Hello , there . What can we do for you today ? __eou__  I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ? __eou__
 I also read that if the customer is a stock investor , which I am , it's possible to get additional benefits ? __eou__  Right again . We can provide a tailored consultation service for you , giving you the latest quotes from the Stock Exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments . __eou__
Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? __eou__  The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! __eou__
 I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? __eou__  I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . __eou__
 And for the Savings Deposit ? __eou__  For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . __eou__

 What is it , Mrs . Wang ? __eou__  It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . __eou__

 What was the rate yesterday ? __eou__  The rate was 1 Australia dollar to 6.5 Yuan yesterday . __eou__
 It does , sir . Do you still want to have it changed now ? __eou__  Let me think ... Will the rate still go down tomorrow ? __eou__
When it comes to select a fund , you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ? __eou__  Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . __eou__
Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ? __eou__  I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . __eou__
Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ? __eou__  No . These terms need to be amplified . __eou__

 Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste .

Mr . Black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ? __eou__  In April or early May . __eou__
 How much would you like ? __eou__  10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity . __eou__

What's your main range ? __eou__  Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products . __eou__
 What are they ? __eou__  First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? __eou__
 That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? __eou__  The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . __eou__
 How do you do , Ms . Chi ? __eou__  Welcome to this corporation , Mr . White . Won ’ t you please sit down ? __eou__
 Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind . __eou__  Yes , we have .

What arrangement will you make about payment ? __eou__  We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg . Is it at sight or after sight ? __eou__
 Christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year , right ? __eou__  But in the United States the Christmas season begins about a month before Dec . 25 . __eou__
 What's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__  I said by the middle of Oct . This is the best we can promise . __eou__
 Do you quote CIF or FOB ? __eou__  It's FOB Shanghai . __eou__

 That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? __eou__  A 10,000 dollar policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He will give you a good deal . __eou__
How are your stocks doing , Jim ? __eou__  Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good . __eou__
 Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Ted ? __eou__  No . What happened ? __eou__

 Yes , I ’ Ve come to inquire about a 6,000- dollar remittance from California . Has it arrived ? __eou__  May I have your name , please ? __eou__
 May I have your name , please ? __eou__  My name is Jenny Clinton . __eou__
 Really ? It should have arrived . It was sent a week ago . __eou__  If the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . But if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week . __eou__
Hello ! How can I help you , sir ? __eou__  I want to take out a loan for school . What kind of interest rate do you offer ? __eou__
 I want to take out a loan for school . What kind of interest rate do you offer ? __eou__  Do you qualify for any of the Federal loan programs ? __eou__
 Do you qualify for any of the Federal loan programs ? __eou__  Yes , but I need to borrow some more money . __eou__
 What's the interest rate ? __eou__  It's 7.2 % , fixed-rate loan . __eou__

Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ? __eou__  Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ... __eou__
 Just a moment , please . Your name ? __eou__  Emily Smith . __eou__
 Do you have an account with this bank ? __eou__  I'm afraid not . __eou__
 What is the interest rate on your card ? __eou__  The annual charge rate is 9.5 % . __eou__
 How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? __eou__  You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . __eou__
 Does the card provide any other benefits ? __eou__  You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card . __eou__
Hello , may I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? __eou__
 Do we need to put on the jackets too ? __eou__  You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step . __eou__
 Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ? __eou__  Well , not fully automated . __eou__
 I see . How do you control the quality ? __eou__  All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process . __eou__
 What ’ s the monthly output ? __eou__  One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October . __eou__
 What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ? __eou__  About 2 % in normal operations . __eou__
 That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ? __eou__  Yes . Shall we take a break now ? __eou__
How large is the plant ? __eou__  It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . __eou__
 It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? __eou__  In the early 70s . We ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . __eou__
 How many employees do you have in this plant ? __eou__  500 . We ’ re running on three shifts . __eou__
 Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? __eou__  Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? __eou__
 It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ? __eou__  Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . __eou__
 That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? __eou__  500 pieces . __eou__
 Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . __eou__  Do you sell direct to shops ? __eou__
 Do you sell direct to shops ? __eou__  Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . __eou__
 Do you keep a stock of these things ? __eou__  In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . __eou__
 According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? __eou__  We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . __eou__
 Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? __eou__  Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . __eou__
 Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? __eou__  Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . __eou__
 What is your proposal ? __eou__  Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally . __eou__
 What would you suggest ? __eou__  The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom . __eou__
 Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up . __eou__  What is it ? __eou__
 I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? __eou__  Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words . __eou__
 Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ? __eou__  How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? __eou__
 Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? __eou__  Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . __eou__
 Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ? __eou__  Tomorrow afternoon . __eou__
How much do you pay wholesale for your products ? __eou__  We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . __eou__
 That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ? __eou__  Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . __eou__
 Is that including tax ? __eou__  No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . __eou__
 How much is your profit margin then ? __eou__  Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % . __eou__
 How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__  To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . __eou__
Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? __eou__  As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . __eou__
 The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? __eou__  To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__  Yes , I would like to exchange some money . __eou__
 what currency would you like to trade in ? __eou__  I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? __eou__
 No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? __eou__  Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? __eou__
 Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? __eou__  It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? __eou__
So how did I do ? __eou__  Not too good , I'm sorry . __eou__
 I lost ? __eou__  It was close.To be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner . __eou__
 So the price was good ? __eou__  Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . __eou__
How much will our order from your factory be ? __eou__  I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days . __eou__
 Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ? __eou__  Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . __eou__
 We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? __eou__  Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? __eou__
 Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? __eou__  We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . That's all I can say . __eou__
Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice . __eou__  Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you . __eou__
 So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ? __eou__  Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ? __eou__
 Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? __eou__  Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off . __eou__
 Than you , I'm not late , am I ? __eou__  No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . __eou__
 Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? __eou__  Please , I wish you would . __eou__
 Sure . Do you have my number ? __eou__  Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . __eou__
Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? __eou__  Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . __eou__
 Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? __eou__  No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . __eou__
 It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? __eou__  A company account . I need to pay a bill . __eou__
 Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . __eou__  I have all the information in this folder . __eou__
 Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? __eou__  Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . __eou__
 Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__  I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . __eou__
 Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? __eou__  It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . __eou__
 How much do you think it would cost ? __eou__  Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . __eou__
 What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ? __eou__  If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ? __eou__
 If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ? __eou__  Yes . __eou__
Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation ? __eou__  China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation __eou__
What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? __eou__  Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . __eou__
 Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? __eou__  Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . __eou__
 Excuse me ? __eou__  Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . __eou__
 What kind of change , just in prices ? __eou__  No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . __eou__
 You mean on product availability , reliability and price ? __eou__  No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision . __eou__
Well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment ? __eou__  We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__
Hi , Bill . It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd . How are you ? __eou__  Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ? __eou__
 Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ? __eou__  Not too bad at all . Do you have a minute ? __eou__
 Not too bad at all . Do you have a minute ? __eou__  Sure , what can I do for you ? __eou__
 I'm really busy right now . I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ? __eou__  Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to . __eou__
 Well , I can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ? __eou__  It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writing.Make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . How soon can I have it ? __eou__
 It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writing.Make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . How soon can I have it ? __eou__  Is this another rush , dear ? Did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? __eou__
 Is this another rush , dear ? Did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? __eou__  Yeah , I'm afraid so . I really need your help here . __eou__
 Carton ? __eou__  Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__
 Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__  Why use wooden cases ? __eou__
 Why use wooden cases ? __eou__  I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . __eou__
 You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? __eou__  That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . __eou__
 Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ? __eou__  Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . __eou__
 Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ? __eou__  A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__
 When will that be ? __eou__  Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit . __eou__
 Good , what about the export packing ? __eou__  Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . __eou__
 Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . __eou__  You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . __eou__
 I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? __eou__  Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . __eou__
 Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? __eou__  20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . __eou__
 Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? __eou__  All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . __eou__
 Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? __eou__  Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . __eou__
 In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? __eou__  Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . __eou__
 What about the outer packing ? __eou__  We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . __eou__
 Cartons ? __eou__  Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__
 Why use wooden cases ? __eou__  I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . __eou__
 Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . __eou__  But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . __eou__
 Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? __eou__  By the middle of October , I think . __eou__
 Like what ? __eou__  Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? __eou__
 That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__  Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__
 And that is ? __eou__  How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? __eou__
 I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? __eou__  Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . __eou__
Hello , Sir , may I help you ? __eou__  Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__
 I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__  It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__
 Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? __eou__  I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . __eou__
 I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . __eou__  I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . __eou__
 In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? __eou__  It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . __eou__
 Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? __eou__  If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . __eou__

 It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way . __eou__  I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . __eou__
 Yeah , I don ’ t mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? __eou__  Yeah . It won ’ t be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . __eou__

Hello , Sir , may I help you ? __eou__  Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__
 I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__  It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__

 Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? __eou__  yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . __eou__

 Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? __eou__  As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . __eou__

 What do you mean ? __eou__  I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . __eou__
 Why ? __eou__  Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . __eou__
 Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? __eou__  I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . __eou__
 Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? __eou__  So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . __eou__
 Sure ? __eou__  Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars . __eou__

 But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . __eou__  I understand .

 Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? __eou__  Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . __eou__
 What are bar vouchers ? __eou__  Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . __eou__

 Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? __eou__  Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . __eou__
 So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? __eou__  Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? __eou__
 Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? __eou__  I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion __eou__

The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours . __eou__
 Yes , flextime has definitely been a good change for us . How do you feel about the pay ? __eou__  At first it is going to be difficult . During the first three months , I'm on probation . So I won't get sales commissions until after that . __eou__

 Return on investment ? How can you have a return on this kind of investment ? Can you really calculate the value of these training programs ? __eou__  Sure ! It's not a real figure , of course . It's just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence . __eou__
